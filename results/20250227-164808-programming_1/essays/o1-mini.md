**TypeScript:**

The TypeScript implementations are well-structured, follow language conventions, and use appropriate variable naming and type annotations. The code is easy to read and understand.

1. **FizzBuzz**: The implementation is correct and handles all cases as expected.

2. **Palindrome Checker**: The implementation is correct and handles edge cases like whitespace and non-alphanumeric characters appropriately. The use of regular expressions makes the code more concise.

3. **Binary Search**: The implementation is correct and follows the standard binary search algorithm. The use of type annotations enhances code clarity and maintainability.

One potential improvement could be to add error handling for invalid inputs, such as empty arrays or non-numeric values.

**Python:**

The Python implementations are clean, concise, and follow the language's naming conventions and best practices.

1. **FizzBuzz**: The implementation is correct and handles all cases as expected.

2. **Palindrome Checker**: The implementation is correct and efficiently handles non-alphanumeric characters using regular expressions. The use of a ternary operator makes the code more concise.

3. **Binary Search**: The implementation is correct and follows the standard binary search algorithm. The use of `//` for integer division is a nice touch.

The code could benefit from additional error handling for invalid inputs, such as empty lists or non-numeric values.

**Rust:**

The Rust implementations demonstrate idiomatic Rust code and take advantage of the language's features, such as pattern matching and functional programming constructs.

1. **FizzBuzz**: The implementation is correct and handles all cases as expected. The use of string concatenation with `push_str` is a nice touch.

2. **Palindrome Checker**: The implementation is correct and handles non-alphanumeric characters efficiently using iterators and filters. The use of functional programming techniques makes the code more readable and maintainable.

3. **Binary Search**: The implementation is correct and follows the standard binary search algorithm. The use of pattern matching in the `match` statement is idiomatic Rust and enhances code readability.

Rust's strong type system ensures that many potential errors are caught at compile-time, but additional error handling for edge cases could be added.

**C:**

The C implementations are straightforward and follow the language's conventions, but they could benefit from additional error handling and improved code structure.

1. **FizzBuzz**: The implementation is correct and handles all cases as expected. However, the use of multiple `if` statements could be improved by using a switch statement or leveraging the modulus operator more efficiently.

2. **Palindrome Checker**: The implementation is correct and handles non-alphanumeric characters appropriately. However, the use of nested loops and multiple indices (`left` and `right`) makes the code harder to read and maintain.

3. **Binary Search**: The implementation is correct and follows the standard binary search algorithm. However, the use of multiple variables (`left`, `right`, `mid`) and the lack of comments make the code harder to follow.

Overall, the C implementations could benefit from better code organization, more comments, and additional error handling for invalid inputs or edge cases.

# Evaluation of Programming Solutions

## TypeScript

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct. It properly prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.

**Code Quality**: The code is clean, concise, and follows TypeScript conventions. The approach of building the output string is elegant.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct. It properly handles case sensitivity and non-alphanumeric characters.

**Code Quality**: The code is clean with proper type annotations. The two-pointer approach is efficient.

### 3. Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct and returns the expected index or -1 if not found.

**Code Quality**: The code is well-structured with appropriate type annotations. The mid-point calculation is vulnerable to integer overflow for very large arrays (although this is unlikely in JavaScript/TypeScript).

**Error Handling**: No explicit error handling for invalid inputs like undefined arrays, which would be a good addition.

## Python

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct, producing the expected output.

**Code Quality**: The code follows Python conventions using snake_case and proper indentation. The main guard pattern is used appropriately.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct and handles special characters correctly.

**Code Quality**: The code is concise and pythonic using the slice notation for string reversal.

### 3. Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct but has a minor spacing inconsistency in the operators (`mid +1` vs. `mid + 1`).

**Code Quality**: Otherwise, the code follows Python conventions and includes type hints for better readability.

## Rust

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct.

**Code Quality**: The code follows Rust conventions and uses idiomatic patterns like the `push_str` method and range syntax `1..=100`.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct.

**Code Quality**: The code leverages Rust's functional programming features (filter, map, collect) making it concise and readable.

### 3. Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct and uses Rust's pattern matching to compare values, which is idiomatic.

**Code Quality**: The code shows good understanding of Rust's type system. The mid-point calculation `left + (right - left) / 2` prevents integer overflow, which is a best practice.

## C

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct but takes a different approach than the other languages. Instead of building a string, it uses separate conditions for each case.

**Code Quality**: The code is clear but doesn't match the string-building approach of other implementations. This isn't wrong, just inconsistent with the other examples.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct.

**Code Quality**: The code properly uses C idioms like pointer iteration. The approach to skip non-alphanumeric characters is well-implemented.

### 3. Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct.

**Code Quality**: The code follows C best practices and uses the safe mid-point calculation formula to prevent integer overflow.

**Error Handling**: The code includes error handling by checking if the element was found before printing the result.

## Overall Assessment

All three problems are implemented in all four languages. The code is generally well-written, following each language's conventions and best practices.

The main areas for improvement:
1. More consistent error handling across implementations
2. More consistent implementation styles across languages (e.g., the C FizzBuzz implementation differs from others)
3. Adding input validation in some implementations

Overall, these are solid implementations that demonstrate proficiency in each language.

Grade: A-

**Letter Grade:** A-
**Numeric Grade:** 3.7

```

**C:**

1) **FizzBuzz**:
   - **Correctness**: Correctly implements the FizzBuzz game.
   - **Code Quality**: While the code works, it could be more concise by combining the conditions for `FizzBuzz`.
   - **Completeness**: Implemented.

   - Combine the conditions for `FizzBuzz`.

2) **Palindrome Checker**:
   - **Correctness**: Correct, but the method for string traversal could be made more idiomatic by skipping initialization of `left` and `right`.
   - **Code Quality**: While clear, there's unnecessary checking for both `isalnum` and `left/right` comparisons, reducing readability.
   - **Completeness**: Implemented correctly.
   - **Error Handling**: `isalnum` and `tolower` can handle any errors internally.

   **Issues/Improvements**: 
   - Remove one of the checks in the while condition.

# Code Evaluation by Language

## TypeScript Evaluation

### FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both, and the number itself otherwise.

**Code Quality**: The code is clean, concise, and follows TypeScript conventions. It uses proper type annotations and the string concatenation approach is elegant.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable for this problem.

### Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies palindromes by removing non-alphanumeric characters and comparing characters from both ends.

**Code Quality**: The code is well-structured with proper type annotations. The two-pointer approach is efficient and clearly implemented.

**Error Handling**: Appropriately handles edge cases by cleaning the input string.

### Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly finds the target in a sorted array and returns -1 when not found.

**Code Quality**: Clean implementation with proper type annotations. The code is readable and follows standard binary search patterns.

**Error Handling**: Returns -1 when the target is not found. One minor improvement could be validating that the input array is sorted.

### TypeScript Overall
All three problems are correctly implemented following TypeScript best practices. The code is clean, type-safe, and efficient.

```
Grade: A
```

## Python Evaluation

### FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly handles all FizzBuzz cases.

**Code Quality**: The code follows Python conventions (PEP 8) and is well-structured. The `if __name__ == "__main__"` idiom is properly used.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable for this problem.

### Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies palindromes.

**Code Quality**: The code leverages Python's strengths with the elegant use of string slicing (`[::-1]`) for reversal. Type hints are properly used.

**Error Handling**: Appropriately handles edge cases with regex cleaning.

### Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly finds elements in a sorted array.

**Code Quality**: Generally good, but contains minor spacing inconsistencies (e.g., `len(arr) -1` instead of `len(arr) - 1`).

**Error Handling**: Returns -1 when the target is not found, but doesn't validate that the input array is sorted.

### Python Overall
All problems are correctly implemented, with minor style inconsistencies in the binary search implementation.

```
Grade: A-
```

## Rust Evaluation

### FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly handles all FizzBuzz cases.

**Code Quality**: The code follows Rust conventions and is well-structured. The use of `String::new()` and conditional output handling is idiomatic.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable for this problem.

### Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies palindromes.

**Code Quality**: Excellent use of Rust's iterator methods (`filter`, `map`, `collect`). The code is idiomatic Rust and showcases functional programming patterns.

**Error Handling**: Properly handles non-alphanumeric characters and case sensitivity.

### Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly finds elements in a sorted array.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable for this problem.

### Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies palindromes.

**Code Quality**: The two-pointer approach is well-implemented and efficient for C. The in-place skipping of non-alphanumeric characters is a good technique.

**Error Handling**: Handles non-alphanumeric characters and case sensitivity, but doesn't check if the input string is NULL, which could cause a segmentation fault.

### Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly finds elements in a sorted array.

**Code Quality**: Generally good implementation. The use of `left + (right - left)/2` helps avoid potential integer overflow.

**Error Handling**: Returns -1 when the target is not found and includes additional error handling in the main function to display an appropriate message.

### Evaluation of Code

Below is an evaluation of each implementation based on the criteria provided: **Correctness**, **Code Quality**, **Completeness**, and **Error Handling**. A grade is assigned at the end based on the assessments.

---

## **TypeScript**

### 1. FizzBuzz
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correctly implements the FizzBuzz logic, iterating from 1 to 100 and handling all cases (`Fizz`, `Buzz`, and `FizzBuzz`).
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Good style; uses TypeScript idioms well and is easy to understand. The use of `let output = ''` and `output || i` is concise and appropriate.
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete and works as expected.
- **Error Handling**: ❌ No error handling (e.g., for invalid input ranges or non-numeric values). However, this is not typically required for FizzBuzz.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correctly checks for palindromes, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.
- **Code Quality**: ✅ High quality. The use of a regex to clean input is idiomatic in TypeScript/JavaScript. The two-pointer approach is clear and efficient.
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete.
- **Error Handling**: ❌ No error handling for invalid input types, though the type signature indicates the function expects a string.

### 3. Binary Search
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correct implementation of binary search. The logic is sound and works for sorted arrays.
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Follows TypeScript conventions. Use of `Math.floor` for mid-point calculation is idiomatic and avoids overflow (though not strictly necessary in JavaScript/TypeScript).
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete.
- **Error Handling**: ❌ Does not check if the input array is sorted. If the input is unsorted, the result will be incorrect.

---

## **Python**

### 1. FizzBuzz
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correct implementation.
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Clean and idiomatic Python. The use of `output or i` is Pythonic and concise.
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete.
- **Error Handling**: ❌ Similar to TypeScript, no error handling for invalid ranges or types.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correctly identifies palindromes.
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Excellent. The use of `re.sub` and slicing (`[::-1]`) is idiomatic Python and concise.
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete.
- **Error Handling**: ❌ Assumes the input is a string. No checks for invalid types.

### 3. Binary Search
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correct.
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Good. The implementation is readable and follows Python conventions. However, using `(left + right) // 2` could theoretically overflow for very large indices in other languages (though not in Python). Consider using `left + (right - left) // 2` for consistency with other languages.
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete.
- **Error Handling**: ❌ No check for sorted arrays.

---

## **Rust**

### 1. FizzBuzz
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correct.
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Excellent. Uses idiomatic Rust constructs like `String::new()` and `push_str`.
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete.
- **Error Handling**: ❌ No error handling, though FizzBuzz typically doesn't require it.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correct.
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Excellent. Uses iterators and functional constructs effectively. The use of `filter`, `map`, and `collect` is idiomatic and efficient.

- **Error Handling**: ❌ No handling for invalid pointers, though this is typical in simple C programs.

### 3. Binary Search
- **Correctness**: ✅ Correct.
- **Code Quality**: ✅ Good. The mid-point calculation avoids overflow, and the function logic is clear.
- **Completeness**: ✅ Complete.
- **Error Handling**: ❌ Does not check for sorted input arrays.

---

## **Summary of Issues Across Languages**
1. **Error Handling**: None of the implementations validate that binary search arrays are sorted or handle potential edge cases (e.g., negative indices, overflow in non-Python languages).
2. **Code Comments**: Some implementations (e.g., Rust and C) lack comments, which could improve readability.
3. **Type Safety**: In languages like Python, there's no explicit type validation for inputs. TypeScript and Rust handle this better due to their type systems.
4. **Consistency**: Binary search implementations should consistently use `left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid potential overflow in other contexts.

---

```
Grade: A-
``` 

### Rationale for Grade:
- The implementations are **correct** and **complete** across all languages.
- **Code quality** is high overall, with clean, idiomatic code.
- The primary area for improvement is **error handling** and additional safeguards like validating sorted arrays for binary search.

Okay, let's evaluate these code solutions according to the provided criteria:

**TypeScript**

*   **Correctness**: All three implementations (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) appear to be logically correct and function as expected based on provided test cases.
*   **Code Quality**: The code follows TypeScript conventions. It utilizes types effectively, making it readable and maintainable.  `fizzbuzz.ts` directly calls `fizzBuzz()` on declaration. Good use of `string` type for palindrome.
*   **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling**: No specific error handling is included, but for these problems with the provided constraints, it's not strictly necessary. Adding checks for invalid palindrome inputs or unsorted binary search arrays could improve robustness but are beyond the stated requirements.

**Python**

*   **Correctness**: All three implementations are correct. The Palindrome Checker uses a regular expression for cleaning, which is an idiomatic and efficient approach. The Binary Search is correct, and FizzBuzz meets specification.
*   **Code Quality**: The code adheres to Python's style guide (PEP 8). Type hints enhance readability. The use of `re.sub` in the palindrome checker is a good choice. `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures the code executes only when run as a script.
*   **Completeness**:  All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling**: Similar to TypeScript, no specific error handling is implemented.

**Rust**

*   **Correctness**: All three implementations are correct.  The Rust implementation of Binary Search is correct, using `std::cmp::Ordering`.  Palindrome check works and so does FizzBuzz.
*   **Code Quality**: The Rust code is idiomatic and memory-safe. The palindrome cleaner makes good use of functional methods from the `Iterator` trait.  The Binary Search implementation is more robust because integer overflows during calculation of mid are avoided.
*   **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling**:  Rust's strong typing and ownership system inherently handle some errors, but explicit error handling (e.g., using `Result`) is not present in these specific implementations. It's acceptable for the problem requirements.

**C**

*   **Correctness**: All three implementations are correct. It is important to check for integer overflows, and the solution does this.
*   **Code Quality**: The C code is functional but is not well-documented. The use of `ctype.h` and `string.h` in the palindrome checker is appropriate. The FizzBuzz implementation is concise due to the use of `i % 15 == 0`.
*   **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling**:  There's no explicit error handling. For example, the binary search could check for `size <= 0`, but this is handled implicitly.

**Overall Assessment and Justification**

All languages have correct and good implementations in their style. C is a little lacking on documentation.

Grade: A

## Graded by: DeepSeek-R1-Full

**TypeScript**  
- **Correctness**: All implementations work correctly. FizzBuzz handles multiples of 15 implicitly by combining 3 and 5 checks, palindrome properly ignores non-alphanumeric characters, and binary search functions as expected.  
- **Code Quality**: Follows conventions. Clear variable names and structure. Type annotations enhance readability.  
- **Error Handling**: No explicit checks for invalid inputs (e.g., unsorted array in binary search), but assumes correct usage.  

**Python**  
- **Correctness**: FizzBuzz, palindrome, and binary search all behave correctly. The palindrome function leverages slicing for concise reversal.  
- **Code Quality**: Complies with PEP8. Snake_case naming and `if __name__ == "__main__"` usage are idiomatic.  
- **Error Handling**: No input validation, but Python's dynamic typing assumes compliant inputs.  

**Rust**  
- **Correctness**: FizzBuzz and palindrome work as intended. **Binary search contains a critical flaw** using `i32` for indices, risking overflow for arrays larger than `i32::MAX`.  
- **Code Quality**: Idiomatic use of iterators and `.filter()`/.`map()`. Misuse of `i32` for indices violates best practices.  
- **Error Handling**: No validation for sorted array input, which is acceptable given standard binary search assumptions.  

**C**  
- **Correctness**: All solutions work correctly. FizzBuzz uses explicit `% 15` check, palindrome skips non-alphanumerics efficiently, and binary search is robust.  
- **Code Quality**: Conventional C style. Clear logic and proper handling of edge cases (e.g., empty strings in palindrome).  
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid characters via `isalnum()` checks but lacks array-sortedness validation in binary search (as expected).  

**Overall Issues**:  
- **Rust binary search's** use of `i32` for indices is incorrect for large arrays. This is a significant correctness issue.  
- Other implementations adhere to language standards and solve the problems effectively.

• FizzBuzz generally does not require error handling.  
• Palindrome checkers assume valid input strings but handle non-alphanumeric characters gracefully.  
• Binary search does not explicitly guard against empty or unsorted arrays, but this is typically acceptable if the inputs are assumed valid.  
• Increasing error checks for invalid input or unusual scenarios (e.g., reading from users, empty arrays) could improve robustness, though not strictly required for these classic examples.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• TypeScript: For additional clarity, consider explicitly returning number in binarySearch and using type definitions more consistently.  
• Rust: Overall strong. One might show more explicit error handling if needed, but for these small examples, it is fine.  
• C: Maintain a uniformly spaced style (e.g., binarysearch.c has some minor spacing inconsistencies), and consider adding checks (like size > 0) if you wanted to handle unexpected arguments gracefully.  

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CONCLUSION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
All solutions are correct, well-structured, and complete for these classic coding tasks. Error handling could be expanded in some cases, but for straightforward demonstrations, the code is of high quality overall.

Below is our detailed evaluation for each language and problem:

─────────────────────────
TypeScript

1. FizzBuzz  
 • Correctness: The loop iterates correctly from 1 to 100; the code correctly builds the output string and prints either the word (or combination) or the number.  
 • Code Quality: The solution is simple, readable, and uses idiomatic TypeScript (using let/const, proper string concatenation, etc.).  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: The code fully meets the problem requirements. For this simple task, no extra error handling is needed.

2. Palindrome Checker  
 • Correctness: The function correctly cleans the string (converting to lower case and removing non-alphanumeric characters) and uses a two-pointer technique to check for palindrome properties.  
 • Code Quality: The regex is clear for cleaning data, and the while loop is straightforward. The code is organized and easy to read.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It meets the requirements; error handling isn’t strictly needed given the input type, although one might consider handling null/undefined inputs in more robust systems.

3. Binary Search  
 • Correctness: The binary search is correctly implemented with proper mid-point calculations and appropriate updates to left/right bounds.  
 • Code Quality: The function follows TypeScript best practices and is well structured.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It returns an index if the target is found or -1 otherwise; in its context, extra error handling isn’t necessary.

─────────────────────────
Python

1. FizzBuzz  
 • Correctness: The loop iterates correctly and builds either “Fizz”, “Buzz” (or both) based on the value of i.  
 • Code Quality: The code follows Python conventions (using range, and the idiom “print(output or i)” is clever).  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It addresses the problem correctly. For simple script usage, additional error handling is not needed.

2. Palindrome Checker  
 • Correctness: The use of regex to filter the input and comparing the string to its reverse is a common, effective solution.  
 • Code Quality: The function is succinct and leverages Python’s strengths, such as slicing for reversing.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It meets the problem requirements well; for production code, one might include checks for non-string input, but that is not required here.

3. Binary Search  
 • Correctness: The iterative implementation correctly calculates the mid index and adjusts the bounds.  
 • Code Quality: The code is clear, with variable names that reflect their purpose.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: The function returns the expected index or -1; given the controlled context, there are no major omissions in error handling.

─────────────────────────
Rust

1. FizzBuzz  
 • Correctness: It correctly prints “Fizz”, “Buzz”, or the number as expected over the 1 to 100 range.  
 • Code Quality: The code uses idiomatic Rust (range-based for loop, String manipulation) and is well-formatted.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: No additional error handling is needed here.

2. Palindrome Checker  
 • Correctness: The function correctly filters for alphanumeric characters, lowers case, and compares the string with its reverse.  
 • Code Quality: The solution leverages Rust’s iterator methods elegantly.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It meets requirements; for a more robust solution, one could potentially signal errors on bad input, but it’s acceptable as-is.

3. Binary Search  
 • Correctness: The binary search implementation is correct and uses a while loop with proper mid index calculation.  
 • Code Quality: The usage of the match expression for comparisons is idiomatic.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: The function cleanly returns an index or -1 in case of no match. Error handling is suitable for this context.

─────────────────────────
C

1. FizzBuzz  
 • Correctness: The implementation correctly checks the multiples (using 15 for combined “FizzBuzz”) and prints the expected output.  
 • Code Quality: The code is clear and follows usual C conventions. The use of if/else if constructs is both efficient and readable.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: For a simple console program, the error handling is acceptable.

2. Palindrome Checker  
 • Correctness: The function correctly uses two indices with proper skipping of non-alphanumeric characters and normalization using tolower.  
 • Code Quality: Including necessary headers and the use of C’s standard library functions (like isalnum and tolower) follows typical C practices.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It handles the task well. In more complex situations, one might validate input length or null pointers, but this basic version is fine.

3. Binary Search  
 • Correctness: The binary search code works as expected, using left/right pointers and correct mid calculation.  
 • Code Quality: The C implementation is standard, readable, and clear.  
 • Completeness & Error Handling: The program checks for a not-found case and prints a message accordingly; overall, it fulfills the assignment without needing extra error handling.

─────────────────────────
Overall Assessment

All implementations across the four languages correctly solve the problems with clear, idiomatic, and complete code. Each language’s solution adheres to typical best practices and conventions. Although none of the code really needs extensive error handling due to the simplicity of the tasks, minor improvements (like additional input validation in real-world scenarios) could be considered. For an interview evaluation focused on correctness, code quality, completeness, and appropriate error handling given the context, these submissions are strong.
