            console.log(i);
        }
    }
}

fizzBuzz();
```

        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {

#### TypeScript

1. **Correctness**: All functions are implemented correctly. `fizzBuzz()` correctly prints the FizzBuzz sequence, `isPalindrome()` accurately identifies palindromes, and `binarySearch()` functions as expected.

2. **Code Quality**: The code adheres to TypeScript conventions. Function names use camelCase, and the use of `const` and `let` for variable declarations is appropriate. The code is well-structured and readable.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented in TypeScript.

4. **Error Handling**: The functions are straightforward, but they do not include specific error handling mechanisms for invalid inputs, particularly in `binarySearch()` (e.g., checking if the array is empty).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Add input validation for `binarySearch()` to handle edge cases (like empty arrays).
  
### Python

1. **Correctness**: All implementations work as intended, showing correct output for FizzBuzz, palindrome checking, and binary searching.

2. **Code Quality**: The code follows Python’s PEP 8 style guide conventions well. Function names are in snake_case, and the use of list comprehensions and built-in functions is effective.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are fully implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: The functions lack explicit error handling. For example, `binary_search()` does not check whether the input array is empty.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Consider adding input validation in `binary_search()` to handle empty lists.
  
### Rust

1. **Correctness**: The implementations are correct and produce the expected outputs for all functions.

2. **Code Quality**: The code is idiomatic Rust. Function and variable naming conventions are followed properly. Usage of pattern matching in `binary_search()` demonstrates effective Rust practices.

3. **Completeness**: All three implementations are present.

4. **Error Handling**: No error handling is provided for invalid input cases such as an empty slice for the binary search.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Add error handling or at least a check for an empty slice in `binary_search()` to return a proper error value or message.

### C

1. **Correctness**: The logic in implementations is sound and returns the correct results for all tasks.

2. **Code Quality**: The C code follows C conventions largely. However, clarity could be improved by encapsulating repeated code (like converting cases) into helper functions.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: The `is_palindrome()` function properly handles non-alphanumeric characters, but more robust checking could be added, such as handling null pointers or empty strings.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Consider factoring out case conversion and alphanumeric checks into separate helper functions and add input validation for the `is_palindrome()` function.

### Overall Assessment
Each language implementation is complete and correct in terms of functionality, although some lack proper error handling or edge case management. The quality of code varies slightly among them, but all generally adhere to their respective style guidelines, demonstrating proficiency in each language's conventions.

- **Correctness**: Correct implementation. It accurately prints out Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz as expected.
- **Code Quality**: The function follows TypeScript conventions, uses `void` return type, and is well-commented. However, some would argue against the use of `let` for loop counters, suggesting `const` instead.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No errors are possible in this implementation, so no error handling is needed.

**Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: The logic for determining a palindrome is correct and efficient.
- **Code Quality**: The use of `toLocaleLowerCase()` could be more explicit with `toLowerCase()`, otherwise, it follows TypeScript conventions well, includes type annotations, and is readable.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling, but for a simple string manipulation function, this is acceptable.

**Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented.
- **Code Quality**: The function uses descriptive variable names, follows conventions for TypeScript, but `mid` calculation could be more explicit with parentheses to prevent floating-point precision issues.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Does not handle the case where the array is empty or not sorted, which would lead to incorrect results or potential runtime errors.

**Grade**: 
```
Grade: A-
```

### Python

**FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: Function correctly prints FizzBuzz values for the numbers 1 to 100.
- **Code Quality**: Pythonic style, uses `range`, and the `if-elif-else` structure is correct. No comments or docstrings, though.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Not applicable in this context.

**Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: Correctly sanitizes and checks palindromes with regular expressions.
- **Code Quality**: Uses type hints, which is good for Python 3.5+. However, no comments or docstrings are included.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: The function could check for empty strings or handle non-string inputs.

**Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: Algorithm works as intended for sorted lists.
- **Code Quality**: Follows Python conventions, uses `//` for integer division, and is succinct. Lack of comments or docstrings.
- **Error Handling**: No checks for an unsorted list or for inputs that are not a list or not in the expected format.

**Grade**:
```
Grade: A-
```

### Rust

**FizzBuzz**

- **Error Handling**: Not applicable in this context.

**Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: Properly checks for palindromes, with all non-alphanumeric characters removed and case-insensitive comparison.
- **Code Quality**: Makes good use of Rust's iterator methods. No comments or docstrings, could include `#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]` for better testing.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling for invalid input.

**Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: Correctly implements binary search for a sorted slice of `i32` numbers.
- **Code Quality**: Uses Rust idioms effectively, uses `isize` for indices and matching to handle comparisons. No docstring or comments.
- **Error Handling**: Returns `-1` if not found, but doesn't indicate an empty or unsorted slice could result in incorrect behavior.

**Grade**:
```
Grade: A
```

### C

**FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: Correctly prints FizzBuzz for numbers 1 through 100.
- **Code Quality**: Follows C conventions; could use more descriptive variable names (like `number` instead of `i`). No comments. 
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Not applicable in this context.

**Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: Correct implementation. Efficiently handles palindrome checking.
- **Code Quality**: The function uses pointers for string manipulation, which is idiomatic but less readable for beginners. No comments or documentation provided.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling for null pointers or invalid strings.

**Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: The binary search logic is implemented correctly.
- **Code Quality**: Follows C conventions well but lacks comments. Using `int` for index operations might lead to issues with very large arrays.
- **Error Handling**: While it returns -1 when not found, there's no explicit error checking for invalid inputs or an empty array.

**Grade**:
```
Grade: B+
```

### Overall Assessment:

- **Completeness**: All three problems have been implemented in all specified languages.
- **Code Quality**: Varies, with Python and Rust showing best practices, while C and TypeScript could benefit from slight enhancements in naming and documentation.

# Evaluation of Programming Solutions

I'll evaluate each language implementation based on correctness, code quality, completeness, and error handling.

## TypeScript

### 1) FizzBuzz
The implementation correctly follows the FizzBuzz rules, iterating from 1 to 100 and printing the appropriate output for each number. The condition checks are in the correct order, testing for divisibility by both 3 and 5 first.

### 2) Palindrome Checker
The implementation correctly removes non-alphanumeric characters and converts to lowercase before checking if the string reads the same backward as forward. The string manipulation methods are used effectively.

### 3) Binary Search
The binary search is implemented correctly with the proper bounds and midpoint calculation to avoid integer overflow. It returns the correct index or -1 if the target is not found.

**Issues/Improvements:**
- All three functions lack input validation. For example, `isPalindrome` doesn't check if the input is null/undefined, and `binarySearch` doesn't verify that the array is sorted.
- Consider adding documentation comments to explain function parameters and return values.

**Overall Assessment:** The TypeScript implementations are correct and follow language conventions. They are well-structured but lack input validation for edge cases.

```
Grade: A-
```

## Python

### 1) FizzBuzz
The implementation is correct and follows Python conventions with proper indentation and a clear structure.

### 2) Palindrome Checker
The implementation effectively uses regex for cleaning the string and the slice notation (`[::-1]`) for reversing the string, which is idiomatic Python.

### 3) Binary Search
The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented with proper integer division (`//`) for midpoint calculation.

**Issues/Improvements:**
- Similar to TypeScript, no input validation is performed for edge cases.
- The code correctly uses type hints, which is a good practice.

**Overall Assessment:** The Python implementations are correct, idiomatic, and use language features effectively. The addition of type hints is a plus, but input validation would improve robustness.

```
Grade: A-
```

## Rust

### 1) FizzBuzz
The implementation is correct and idiomatic, using Rust's inclusive range syntax (`1..=100`) and efficiently checking for divisibility by 15 directly.

### 2) Palindrome Checker
The implementation uses iterators and functional-style operations, which is idiomatic Rust. It correctly filters and transforms characters.

### 3) Binary Search
The binary search implementation uses pattern matching, which is a nice Rust feature. It properly handles type conversions between isize and usize.

**Issues/Improvements:**
- The binary search would be more idiomatic if it returned `Option<usize>` instead of `isize` with -1 for not found.
- Edge cases are handled implicitly by Rust's type system, but explicit handling would be clearer.

**Overall Assessment:** The Rust implementations leverage language features well and follow idioms. They're correct and efficient, with minor opportunities for more idiomatic error handling.

```
Grade: A
```

## C

### 1) FizzBuzz
The implementation is correct and efficiently checks for divisibility by 15 first, which is a small optimization.

### 2) Palindrome Checker
The implementation uses a two-pointer approach, which is memory-efficient and appropriate for C. It correctly handles non-alphanumeric characters and case insensitivity.

### 3) Binary Search
The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented with proper midpoint calculation to avoid overflow.

**Issues/Improvements:**
- The code lacks crucial error handling for null pointers in `is_palindrome` and `binary_search`.
- No validation that the input array is sorted for binary search.
- Missing checks for array size (e.g., if size <= 0) in binary search.

**Overall Assessment:** The C implementations are correct and use efficient algorithms, but they lack important safety checks that are essential in C programming where memory safety isn't guaranteed by the compiler.

```
Grade: B+
```

## Summary

All implementations are functionally correct and complete (all three problems are implemented in all four languages). The main differences are in code quality and error handling, with Rust and TypeScript/Python showing stronger idiomatic usage and C needing more robust error checking.

**Letter Grade:** A-
**Numeric Grade:** 3.7

### Evaluation

#### TypeScript

**1) FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows TypeScript conventions and is readable. It can be improved by using modern TypeScript features like type annotations and returning `string` instead of `void`.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling is necessary for this problem, but adding input validation checks (`if (i < 1 || i > 100)`) would be a good practice for robustness.
  
**2) Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows TypeScript conventions and is readable. It can be made more robust by checking for empty strings.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling is provided, although the implementation is quite simple.
  
**3) Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows TypeScript conventions and is readable.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: The function does not specify the types of errors, e.g., invalid input types that may lead to runtime errors.
  - Adding a check for nullability could improve robustness:
    ```typescript
    function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number | undefined {
        if (!arr || arr.length === 0) {
            return undefined;
        }
        // Rest of the implementation...
    }
    ```

#### Python

**1) FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows Python conventions and is readable.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling is necessary for this problem, but adding an assertion for the range might enhance readability:
  ```python
  assert 1 <= n <= 100, "Ensure n is within the range of 1 to 100."
  ```

**2) Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows Python conventions and is readable.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling is provided, but it is generally assumed the string inputs will not cause issues.

**3) Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows Python conventions and is readable.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Similar to the TypeScript binary search function, type checking and handling unexpected inputs with appropriate exceptions such as:
  ```python
  def binary_search(arr: list[int], target: int) -> int:
      if not isinstance(arr, list):
          raise ValueError("Input must be a list")
      left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
      # Rest of the implementation...
  ```

#### Rust

**1) FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows Rust conventions and is readable. It can be made cleaner by using `to_string()` instead of `from_iter()`.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Rust's strong type system implicitly handles most errors. However, for educational purposes, a `panic!()` in non-test environments or custom error handling can be added.
  
**2) Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows Rust conventions and is readable. However, leveraging `.to_ascii_lowercase()` directly on the characters could improve efficiency.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Rust handles errors more explicitly. A possible improvement is to convert the function to return a result and handle potential errors.
  
**3) Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows Rust conventions and is readable.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling for out-of-range indices should be considered. Rust’s borrow checker ensures safety, so error messages might be added through `unwrap_or_else`.

#### C

**1) FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows C conventions and is readable but lacks modern best practices such as dynamic allocation and modular code structures.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling is minimal. Given C's low-level nature, it's critical to ensure proper memory management.

**2) Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows C conventions, but it can use macros or inline functions for character checks for better performance.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: The function handles invalid alphanumeric characters. C’s manual memory management adds complexity, and ensuring null terminators are present should be checked.

**3) Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows C conventions and is readable.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: C does not have built-in exception handling. To add robustness, consider checking for pointer validity and array boundaries before dereferencing.

### TypeScript

#### 1) FizzBuzz
- **Correctness**: The implementation correctly prints "FizzBuzz" when divisible by both 3 and 5, "Fizz" when divisible by 3, "Buzz" when divisible by 5, and the number otherwise. It works as expected for inputs 1 through 100.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean, readable, and follows TypeScript conventions. Variables are named appropriately (`i`, `console.log`).
- **Error Handling**: FizzBuzz has no user input or error-prone situations, so no error handling is needed.

- **Code Quality**: Code readability is good, and the use of regex for cleaning the input is idiomatic in TypeScript.
- **Error Handling**: The palindrome checker has no input validation because it expects a string, but it assumes valid string input. There's no explicit guard against `null` or non-string inputs.

#### 3) Binary Search
- **Correctness**: The binary search logic is correct, and the algorithm works efficiently (O(log n)) for sorted arrays.
- **Code Quality**: Good structure and use of TypeScript types. The index calculation to prevent overflow (`left + (right - left) / 2`) is a nice touch.
- **Error Handling**: The function assumes a valid sorted array and doesn’t handle unsorted inputs or cases where the array contains duplicates. For TypeScript, input validation could improve robustness.

### Python

#### 1) FizzBuzz
- **Correctness**: The implementation correctly handles the FizzBuzz rules. The logic is simple and efficient.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean and pythonic. `range(1, 101)` is used correctly, and the code is easy to read and understand.
- **Error Handling**: Same as TypeScript; FizzBuzz doesn't demand error handling as it deals with static range inputs.

#### 2) Palindrome Checker
- **Correctness**: The palindrome checker correctly handles non-alphanumeric characters, ignores case, and uses slicing for string reversal.
- **Code Quality**: Code follows Python idioms. The use of regex and slicing (`[::-1]`) is both simple and idiomatic.
- **Error Handling**: Similar to TS, this function assumes valid string input and has no protection against `None` or non-string inputs.

#### 3) Binary Search
- **Correctness**: The binary search logic is correct and works efficiently on sorted lists. The use of integer division is appropriate (`//`).
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean and follows Python’s conventions. The function is well-named, and the logic is easy to follow.
- **Error Handling**: Assumes the list is sorted and has no input validation. It could benefit from type hints or documentation.

### Rust

#### 1) FizzBuzz
- **Correctness**: The FizzBuzz logic is correct and matches the traditional output. The use of `1..=100` ensures all numbers from 1 to 100 are processed.
- **Code Quality**: Code is well-structured and idiomatic in Rust. The `println!` macro is used correctly.
- **Error Handling**: N/A — no user input or error-prone situations.

#### 2) Palindrome Checker
- **Correctness**: The palindrome checker correctly removes non-alphanumeric characters, converts to lowercase, and checks for palindrome properties using `eq` with reversed characters.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean and leverages Rust’s powerful iterator methods effectively (`filter`, `map`, `collect`).
- **Error Handling**: The function assumes valid string input. No explicit checks are included.

#### 3) Binary Search
- **Correctness**: The binary search logic works efficiently and is implemented correctly. The use of a signed integer (`isize`) ensures overflow safety in index arithmetic.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows Rust conventions. The use of `match` and slicing improves readability.
- **Error Handling**: Assumes sorted input; could benefit from input validation for unsorted arrays.

### C

#### 1) FizzBuzz
- **Correctness**: The implementation follows the exact rules of FizzBuzz, using moduli for number divisibility and printing the expected strings.
- **Code Quality**: Code structure is simple and efficient. The control flow is clear and readable, following typical C practices.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling is necessary as the logic is static and deterministic.

#### 2) Palindrome Checker
- **Correctness**: The palindrome checker handles alphanumeric checking, ignores non-letters and non-numbers, and is case-insensitive using `tolower`. The function works correctly on various test cases.
- **Code Quality**: Code is readable but could be slightly improved. The two-pointer technique is a classic way to solve this problem in C.
- **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling, but `isalnum` is used correctly to filter characters.

#### 3) Binary Search
- **Correctness**: The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented and works as expected on sorted arrays.
- **Code Quality**: The approach is straightforward and idiomatic for C. The use of explicit index arithmetic makes the logic visible.
- **Error Handling**: Assumes sorted input, but does not enforce this. Input validation could be added to make the function more robust.

---

### Overall Evaluation:

1. **Correctness**: All algorithms work as expected without any logic errors across all languages.
2. **Code Quality**: The code adheres to language conventions and is generally well-written in all implementations. The logic is easy to follow, structured properly, and idiomatic.
3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented in all four languages.
4. **Error Handling**: Error handling is adequate for the given scope, but more robustness in input validation would be beneficial for all binary searches and palindrome checkers across the languages.

### Final Grade:

Below is a detailed assessment of each language’s implementation, considering correctness, code quality, completeness, and error handling. An overall grade follows at the end.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeScript
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Correctness:
   • FizzBuzz: Correctly prints “Fizz,” “Buzz,” or “FizzBuzz” for the appropriate multiples.  
   • Palindrome Checker: Replaces non-alphanumeric characters using a regular expression, lowercases, and checks the reversed string. Works correctly.  
   • Binary Search: Implements a standard binary search. Handles the boundary conditions properly and returns -1 if not found.  

2) Code Quality:
   • Uses modern TypeScript features (e.g., let for variable declaration, strict equality checks).  
   • Code is concise, readable, and follows typical TypeScript/JavaScript conventions.  
   • Adding function return types (e.g., “: boolean”) can make it even more explicit, although TypeScript can infer them in these cases.

3) Completeness:
   • All three problems are implemented.  

4) Error Handling:
   • No explicit error handling is included, but for these small examples, that is acceptable.  
   • In a production context, handling edge cases (e.g., empty strings or arrays) or invalid inputs might be considered.

Areas for Improvement:
   • Optionally, define explicit return types for TypeScript functions to reinforce type checking and clarity.  
   • For large inputs or real-world usage, consider edge-case handling (e.g., binarySearch called with an empty array).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Python
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Correctness:
   • FizzBuzz: Standard implementation; prints correctly for each multiple.  
   • Palindrome Checker: Uses a regular expression to remove non-alphanumeric characters, performs a reverse slice comparison. Correct for typical use cases.  
   • Binary Search: Correctly handles the typical while loop approach and returns −1 if not found.

2) Code Quality:
   • Follows Pythonic conventions with clear variable naming and concise logic.  
   • Straightforward, readable, and uses built-in functionality effectively.

3) Completeness:
   • All three tasks are implemented.  

4) Error Handling:
   • Similar to the TypeScript version, no explicit error handling is shown (e.g., handling an empty array for binary_search), but the code is structurally sound for the given examples.

Areas for Improvement:
   • Could add checks or raise exceptions for invalid inputs (such as a None instead of a string or a non-list argument for binary_search) in more robust scenarios.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rust
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Correctness:
   • FizzBuzz: Uses the range 1..=100 and correctly prints the expected strings.  
   • Palindrome Checker: Filters input to alphanumeric characters, lowercases them, and compares the cleaned string to its reverse. Correct for a palindrome check.  
   • Binary Search: Implements a typical while loop with mid-point calculation and returns −1 if not found. Correct indexing logic using mid as isize.

2) Code Quality:
   • Idiomatic Rust for iteration and string collection.  
   • Binary search uses pattern matching nicely (x if x == target, x if x < target, etc.).  
   • The code is well-structured, readable, and leverages Rust’s ownership and type system appropriately.

3) Completeness:
   • All three problems are implemented in a single file with a main function.  

4) Error Handling:
   • No dedicated error handling beyond the core logic. Generally acceptable for these examples.

Areas for Improvement:
   • Consider edge cases for empty arrays in binary_search (though the code handles it gracefully by ensuring left > right eventually).  
   • Could split out test-like calls (e.g., println! for the results) into separate unit tests for more production-like code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Correctness:
   • FizzBuzz: Checks % 15, % 3, and % 5. Correct for standard FizzBuzz in C.  
   • Palindrome Checker: Uses two pointers, skipping non-alphanumeric characters and comparing in a case-insensitive manner—logic is correct.  
   • Binary Search: Typical iterative approach, calculates mid, compares, and returns −1 if not found. Correct results.

2) Code Quality:
   • Straightforward procedural C style, easy to follow.  
   • Uses standard library functions (strlen, isalnum, tolower) appropriately.

3) Completeness:
   • All three problems are fully covered.

4) Error Handling:
   • Minimal error handling. For example, no checks for negative array sizes or null pointers. However, for demonstration code, this is often acceptable.

Areas for Improvement:
   • Could handle potentially invalid strings (e.g., NULL input in is_palindrome) or array size issues in binary_search.  
   • Separate the demos from the main function if you want to scale or integrate these functions into larger projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary and Overall Assessment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Correctness: All solutions for all languages appear logically and functionally correct.  
• Code Quality: Generally good; each language’s idioms are followed. The implementations are clean and readable. Minor improvements could be made by adding explicit error handling or more robust input checks.  
• Completeness: FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search are implemented in all four languages.  
• Error Handling: Minimal in all examples. While adequate for demonstration, some real-world contexts might require more robust error handling or boundary checks.

Below is a language‐by‐language evaluation:

─────────────────────────────  
TypeScript  
─────────────────────────────  
1) FizzBuzz  
• Correctness: The loop from 1 to 100 and the if/else chain work as expected.  
• Code Quality: The code is clear and follows typical TypeScript style.  
• Completeness: FizzBuzz is fully implemented.  
• Error Handling: There’s no special error handling needed for this task.  

2) Palindrome Checker  
• Correctness: The code correctly cleans the string (removing non‐alphanumeric characters and lowercasing) and compares it to its reverse.  
• Code Quality: The use of regular expressions and built-in string methods is concise and idiomatic.  
• Completeness: The solution covers the given test case.  
• Error Handling: Input cleanup is performed, though no explicit error handling is provided—which is acceptable for this problem.

3) Binary Search  
• Correctness: The implementation correctly computes the mid index and adjusts the search window.  
• Code Quality: The algorithm is clearly presented; using Math.floor on the computed mid is safe though one might simplify the calculation in strictly integer arithmetic.  
• Completeness: The problem is completely implemented with a sample test.  
• Error Handling: No additional error handling is necessary given the controlled inputs.

─────────────────────────────  
Python  
─────────────────────────────  
1) FizzBuzz  
• Correctness: Loops correctly over the range [1, 101) and prints the expected outputs.  
• Code Quality: The code is straightforward, readable, and idiomatic Python.  
• Completeness: Fully implemented without any gaps.  
• Error Handling: For this simple task, explicit error checking is unnecessary.  

2) Palindrome Checker  
• Correctness: Uses a regular expression to remove unwanted characters and tests for palindromicity correctly.  
• Code Quality: Clear, concise, and makes good use of Python slicing.  
• Completeness: Satisfies the problem requirements.  
• Error Handling: Input normalization is handled well, and potential edge cases (empty string) are inherently managed by the logic.

3) Binary Search  
• Correctness: Implements the binary search algorithm properly and returns the correct index or -1.  
• Code Quality: The clear use of bounds and mid calculation follows best practices.  
• Completeness: All aspects of the algorithm are present.  
• Error Handling: The implementation assumes a properly sorted array, which is standard for binary search.

─────────────────────────────  
Rust  
─────────────────────────────  
1) FizzBuzz  
• Correctness: The loop over 1..=100 and the condition ordering (using i % 15 for FizzBuzz) make the output correct.  
• Code Quality: The code is idiomatic with a clear separation of concerns.  
• Completeness: Fully implemented in its own main function.  
• Error Handling: No error conditions are present that require special handling.  

2) Palindrome Checker  
• Correctness: The function correctly filters only alphanumeric characters, lowercases them, and compares with its reverse.  
• Code Quality: The use of iterators and chaining is very idiomatic in Rust; however, rebuilding two separate String objects (one for the cleaned string and one for its reverse) might be streamlined for performance in a real-world scenario.  
• Completeness: Fully implemented with example output.  
• Error Handling: The simple input does not have error-prone aspects; input cleaning is adequate.

3) Binary Search  
• Correctness: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly. Converting the array length to an isize and using a while loop is acceptable.  
• Code Quality: The use of pattern matching adds clarity; however, returning an isize where an Option<usize> might be more idiomatic in Rust is a minor area of improvement.  
• Completeness: The solution covers the standard binary search functionality.  
• Error Handling: There’s no explicit check for a null array (not required in Rust given slice safety) or unsorted data, which is acceptable in this context.

─────────────────────────────  
C  
─────────────────────────────  
1) FizzBuzz  
• Correctness: Correctly iterates from 1 to 100 and prints "Fizz," "Buzz," and "FizzBuzz" as expected.  
• Code Quality: Code is straightforward and clear, following common C idioms.  
• Completeness: The implementation covers the functional requirements entirely.  
• Error Handling: For this simple problem, no further error handling is needed.

2) Palindrome Checker  
• Correctness: The function correctly skips non-alphanumeric characters and compares characters in a case-insensitive manner.  
• Code Quality: The use of standard library functions (strlen, isalnum, tolower) is appropriate though one minor potential improvement is guarding against NULL pointers for production-grade code.  
• Completeness: It fully implements the requested functionality.  
• Error Handling: While it assumes a valid string input, explicit NULL pointer checks could be added in a more robust implementation.

3) Binary Search  
• Correctness: The implementation correctly calculates the mid index and returns the matching index or -1 if not found.  
• Code Quality: The arithmetic for calculating the mid and adjusting boundaries is clear and typical for C implementations.  
• Completeness: Everything required for the binary search is present.  
• Error Handling: The function assumes a valid sorted array; additional validations could be added for safety but are not strictly necessary.

Overall Assessment  
─────────────────────────────  
All languages present complete solutions for FizzBuzz, a Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search. The implementations are correct and generally follow good coding practices in their respective languages. While there are a few minor areas where improvements (such as more idiomatic error handling in Rust or NULL checks in C) could be made, these do not detract from the overall quality given the scope of the problems.
