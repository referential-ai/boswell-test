# Classic Programming Problems in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C

## 1. FizzBuzz

### TypeScript
```typescript
/**
 * Prints FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 100.
 */
function fizzBuzz(): void {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("FizzBuzz");
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
            console.log("Fizz");
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("Buzz");
        } else {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
}

// Execute FizzBuzz
fizzBuzz();
```

### Python
```python
def fizz_buzz():
    """
    Prints FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 100.
    """
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

# Execute FizzBuzz
if __name__ == "__main__":
    fizz_buzz()
```

### Rust
```rust
fn fizz_buzz() {
    // Iterate through numbers 1 to 100
    for i in 1..=100 {
        if i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0 {
            println!("FizzBuzz");
        } else if i % 3 == 0 {
            println!("Fizz");
        } else if i % 5 == 0 {
            println!("Buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", i);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Execute FizzBuzz
    fizz_buzz();
}
```

### C
```c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * Prints FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 100.
 */
void fizz_buzz() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
            printf("FizzBuzz\n");
        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            printf("Fizz\n");
        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            printf("Buzz\n");
        } else {
            printf("%d\n", i);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Execute FizzBuzz
    fizz_buzz();
    return 0;
}
```

## 2. Palindrome Checker

### TypeScript
```typescript
/**
 * Checks if a string is a palindrome, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.
 * @param input The string to check
 * @returns true if the string is a palindrome, false otherwise
 */
function isPalindrome(input: string): boolean {
    if (input === null || input === undefined) {
        throw new Error("Input cannot be null or undefined");
    }
    
    // Convert to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters
    const cleanedInput = input.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');
    
    // Check if empty after cleaning
    if (cleanedInput.length === 0) {
        return true; // Empty strings are palindromes by definition
    }
    
    // Compare characters from both ends moving inward
    let left = 0;
    let right = cleanedInput.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        if (cleanedInput[left] !== cleanedInput[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Test cases
try {
    console.log(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"));  // true
    console.log(isPalindrome("race a car"));  // false
    console.log(isPalindrome("No 'x' in Nixon"));  // true
    console.log(isPalindrome(""));  // true
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
}
```

### Python
```python

    Args:
        input_str: The string to check

**FizzBuzz Evaluation**

The FizzBuzz implementations are correct and work as expected across all four languages. The code is well-structured and follows language conventions. Error handling is not explicitly required for this problem, as there are no potential errors to handle given the nature of the problem statement.

**Palindrome Checker Evaluation**

The Palindrome Checker implementations are correct and handle various cases, including empty strings, strings with non-alphanumeric characters, and case-insensitive matching. The TypeScript, Python, and Rust implementations follow language conventions and best practices. The C implementation has a few areas for improvement:

1. The memory allocation and deallocation should be done more safely, using appropriate error checking and handling.
2. The input string should be copied to a separate buffer before modifying it, as modifying a string literal can lead to undefined behavior.
3. The use of `isalnum` and `tolower` functions assumes the input is in the ASCII character set, which may not be appropriate for handling Unicode characters.

**Binary Search Evaluation**

The Binary Search implementations are correct and work as expected across all four languages. The code is well-structured and follows language conventions. The TypeScript, Python, and Rust implementations include appropriate error handling for invalid inputs. The C implementation has a few areas for improvement:

1. Error handling could be more robust, with separate handling for NULL input and invalid array size.
2. The function could return a more meaningful error code or error message instead of just -1 for cases where the target is not found.

**Completeness**

Below is a detailed assessment of each programming problem implemented in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C:

### 1. **FizzBuzz**

**TypeScript**
- **Correctness**: Works as expected, no bugs.
- **Code Quality**: Follows TypeScript conventions. Could benefit from type annotations for return types (`void` isn't needed here since `console.log` doesn't require it) for completeness. Uses arrow functions which align with newer TypeScript practices.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No need for error handling in this simple case.

```
Grade: A
```

**Python**
- **Correctness**: Functions correctly.
- **Code Quality**: Follows Python idioms but could improve readability by adding a space after commas in function calls (`print("Fizz")` instead of `print("Fizz")`). Uses `range` correctly, but the `==` comparison for `i % 3 == 0` is slightly redundant since `%` already provides `True/False` for zero.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling needed.

```
Grade: A-
```

**Rust**
- **Correctness**: No issues.
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured, Rust idiomatic, and clean. Uses `println!` macro appropriately. 
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Not necessary in this context.

```
Grade: A+
```

**C**
- **Correctness**: Works fine, but could benefit from a `#ifndef` guard for the include files.
- **Code Quality**: Well-formed for C, but lacks comment on why `{` is on a new line. Using `#include <stdio.h>` directly is common in small examples but might violate guidelines in larger projects about indirect includes.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: None required.

```
Grade: A-
```

### 2. **Palindrome Checker**

**TypeScript**
- **Correctness**: Accurately checks for palindromes, handles edge cases like empty strings well.
- **Code Quality**: Follows TypeScript conventions, uses good practices like `const`, arrow functions, and `try-catch` for errors. Descriptions could be more detailed.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Throws errors for invalid inputs, clean handling of edge cases.

```
Grade: A+
```

**Python**
- **Correctness**: Correct implementation but overly complex regex for cleaning could be a performance issue for large inputs.
- **Code Quality**: Follows Python conventions, uses `re.sub` for string cleaning which might be excessive. Uses type hints which are good practice.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling for incorrect input types.

```
Grade: A-
```

**Rust**
- **Correctness**: Works well, effective use of functional programming paradigms.
- **Code Quality**: Uses idiomatic Rust coding with good readability. The use of `filter` and `collect` for cleaning the string is very Rust-like.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling explicitly shown but the function handles potential issues like empty strings or invalid characters implicitly.

```
Grade: A+
```

**C**
- **Correctness**: No runtime errors, correctly handles all inputs.
- **Code Quality**: Code is very clean, but the memory management could be improved by using `realloc` instead of `malloc`. Typed parameters would be better (`const char* input` instead of `input`).
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Uses `fprintf` for error reporting which is acceptable, but also allocates and frees memory which could be prone to memory leaks if not cleaned up after errors.

```
Grade: A-
```

### 3. **Binary Search**

**TypeScript**
- **Correctness**: Correct implementation of binary search.
- **Code Quality**: Good use of TypeScript features, though could benefit from more detailed variable naming (e.g., `leftBound` instead of `left` for clarity). 
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Throws errors for incorrect input types, which is good practice.

```
Grade: A+
```

**Python**
- **Correctness**: Function works correctly but could improve readability with clearer naming for variables.
- **Code Quality**: Uses Python idioms well but lacks a space in `(left + right) // 2` for readability.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Handles incorrect input types.

```
Grade: A-
```

**Rust**
- **Correctness**: The logic is sound, and it correctly performs binary search.
- **Code Quality**: Idiomatic use of borrowed slices and error handling not needed for simple searching.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Implicitly handles boundary conditions well.

```
Grade: A+
```

**C**
- **Correctness**: No bugs; handles the binary search algorithm well.
- **Code Quality**: Good coding practices but lacks comments for binary search implementation logic. The variable naming could be improved for clarity.
- **Completeness**: Fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling with `fprintf` for warnings.

```
Grade: A
```

## Graded by: Gemini Flash 2.0

Okay, I've reviewed the provided code for FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C. Here's my assessment based on the criteria you outlined:

**1. Correctness:**

*   **FizzBuzz:** All implementations (TypeScript, Python, Rust, C) are correct and produce the expected output for the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to 100.
*   **Palindrome Checker:** All implementations (TypeScript, Python, Rust, C) correctly identify palindromes, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters. The empty string case is also handled correctly.
*   **Binary Search:** All implementations (TypeScript, Python, Rust, C) correctly perform binary search on a sorted array and return the index of the target value or -1 if not found.

**2. Code Quality:**

*   **TypeScript:** Code is well-structured, readable, and uses appropriate TypeScript types. The `isPalindrome` and `binarySearch` functions have excellent docstrings.
*   **Python:** Code is clean and follows Pythonic conventions. Type hints are used effectively for improved readability. The functions have good docstrings.
*   **Rust:** Code is idiomatic and makes good use of Rust's features (e.g., `filter`, `to_lowercase()`). Rust's ownership and borrowing are handled correctly.
*   **C:** Code uses standard C libraries and conventions. Memory management (in the Palindrome Checker) is handled correctly with `malloc` and `free`. The code is well-commented.

**3. Completeness:**

All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) are implemented in all four languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C).

**4. Error Handling:**

*   **TypeScript:** The Palindrome Checker and Binary Search include error handling for invalid input (null/undefined for Palindrome, and non-array input for Binary Search). Errors are thrown with descriptive messages.
*   **Python:** The Palindrome Checker and Binary Search include error handling for invalid input (non-string/non-list input). Errors are caught with `try...except` blocks and informative error messages are printed.
*   **Rust:** The Rust code relies significantly on compile-time error checking due to Rust's safety features. Input validation is already inherently strong when the correct types are used. In the implementation we have, there is an early return for the empty case which acts a case of error handling.

*   **C:**  The C code includes error handling for `NULL` input in `is_palindrome` and `binary_search`, as well as memory allocation failure in `is_palindrome`. Errors are reported to `stderr`. The usage of `(unsigned char)` cast when calling functions like `isalnum` and `tolower` in `is_palindrome` demonstrates good defensive programming practices to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

After careful review, here's the final grade, following your provided format:

```
Grade: A
```

**Letter Grade:** A
**Numeric Grade:** 4.0

## Graded by: Gemini Pro 1.5

**FizzBuzz:**

All FizzBuzz implementations are correct and handle the problem as expected.  Code quality is good across the board, following language conventions and best practices.  No improvements are necessary.

**Palindrome Checker:**

* **TypeScript:** Correct, good quality, and handles empty strings and null/undefined inputs gracefully.
* **Python:** Correct, good quality,  uses regex effectively, and handles invalid input types.
* **Rust:** Correct and good quality. Efficient use of iterators and `collect()`.
* **C:**  Correct implementation. Good error handling for the NULL input case.  However, it would be even better to use `calloc` instead of `malloc` and a separate loop, which initializes all to `zero` and avoids potential issues if string operations are used later on `cleaned`.

**Binary Search:**

* **TypeScript:** Correct and efficient binary search. Handles non-array input.
* **Python:** Correct implementation and handles the invalid type input.
* **Rust:**  Correct and efficient. Uses the `left + (right - left) / 2` idiom to avoid potential integer overflow issues, a good practice.
* **C:** Correct implementation with proper error handling for NULL input and empty/invalid sized arrays.

**Completeness:**

All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) are implemented in all four languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C).

**Error Handling:**

Error handling is generally good across all implementations. TypeScript, Python, and C implementations for Palindrome Checker and Binary Search include explicit checks for invalid input and throw/raise/print errors appropriately. Rust relies more on type safety but handles edge cases (empty strings for Palindrome Checker and specific error return values for Binary Search) gracefully.

**Assessment**

### **TypeScript**
1. **Correctness**: All implementations work correctly. The palindrome checker properly handles edge cases and type checks.
2. **Code Quality**: Follows TypeScript conventions. The `isPalindrome` null/undefined check is redundant with strict type enforcement but adds runtime safety.
3. **Error Handling**: Adequate checks for invalid inputs in `binarySearch`.

### **Python**
1. **Correctness**: All solutions are correct. The palindrome checker uses regex for cleaning, matching the problem’s intent.
2. **Code Quality**: Clean and idiomatic. Type hints and docstrings enhance readability.
3. **Error Handling**: Properly raises `TypeError` for invalid inputs.

### **Rust**
1. **Correctness**: 
   - **Palindrome Checker**: Uses Unicode-aware `is_alphanumeric`, which may include non-ASCII characters (ambiguous per problem spec).
   - **Binary Search**: Uses `i32` for indices, risking overflow for large arrays (non-idiomatic and potentially incorrect).
2. **Code Quality**: Mostly idiomatic, but the binary search’s index type is a notable flaw.
3. **Error Handling**: No issues; leverages Rust’s type system effectively.

### **C**
1. **Correctness**:
   - **Palindrome Checker**: 
     - Returns `false` on memory allocation failure (incorrectly conflating errors with result).
     - Uses locale-dependent `isalnum`/`tolower`, which may behave unexpectedly for non-ASCII inputs.
   - **Binary Search**: Uses `int` for array size, risking overflow for large arrays.
2. **Code Quality**: Verbose but functional. Memory management in `is_palindrome` is error-prone.
3. **Error Handling**: Critical flaw in `is_palindrome`’s handling of `malloc` failure.

### **Summary of Issues**
- **C**: Major correctness issue in `is_palindrome` (memory errors), locale-dependent checks.
- **Rust**: Binary search uses `i32` indices, risking overflow.
- **TypeScript/Python**: Minor redundancy in type checks but otherwise solid.

### **Grade**
**Grade: B+**  
The implementations are mostly correct and well-structured, but critical issues in C (memory handling) and Rust (index overflow) prevent a higher grade. Python and TypeScript solutions are exemplary.

**Letter Grade:** B+
**Numeric Grade:** 3.3

## Graded by: o1

Below is a detailed assessment of each language’s implementations, followed by an overall grade at the end.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) CORRECTNESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• All FizzBuzz implementations correctly print the sequence from 1 to 100, substituting "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of 15.
• All Palindrome Checker implementations correctly normalize inputs (to lowercase, removing non-alphanumeric characters) before comparing from both ends. Each returns the expected boolean result.
• All Binary Search implementations follow the proper algorithm and return the index of the target or -1 if not found, covering edge cases like empty arrays or invalid inputs.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) CODE QUALITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TypeScript:
• FizzBuzz: Straightforward, idiomatic use of for loops and console.log.  
• Palindrome Checker: Good null/undefined checks; uses a replace() with regex to strip non-alphanumeric characters.  
• Binary Search: Proper error checks for array, well-structured while loop with mid calculation.

Python:
• FizzBuzz: Uses Python’s idiomatic range() and conditional structure effectively.  
• Palindrome Checker: Incorporates clean error raising (TypeError) if input is not a string; uses regex to simplify stripping of non-alphanumeric characters.  
• Binary Search: Readable, Pythonic approach using while left <= right. Clear error check for a list input.

Rust:
• FizzBuzz: Idiomatic for loop with correct range (1..=100). Clear print statements.  
• Palindrome Checker: Uses to_lowercase and filter for alphanumeric. The while loop with indices is straightforward and idiomatic Rust.  
• Binary Search: Works with slices &[i32], using left and right bounds as i32 for indexing. Code is concise and follows typical Rust patterns.

C:
• FizzBuzz: Straightforward for loop and printf calls.  
• Palindrome Checker: Manages memory via malloc/free, carefully strips non-alphanumeric characters, handles NULL input. Good checks and returns the correct result.  
• Binary Search: Checks for NULL arrays and invalid sizes, uses a simple while loop, calculates mid appropriately, returns -1 if not found.

Overall, the code across all languages is organized, readable, and follows standard idioms.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) COMPLETENESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Each of the three problems—FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search—is implemented in all four languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C). The solutions are present and functional.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) ERROR HANDLING
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• FizzBuzz doesn’t rely on user input, so error handling is minimal (and typically not required).  
• Palindrome Checkers in TypeScript, Python, and C handle invalid/null inputs (throwing exceptions or printing errors). Rust’s signature uses &str, which naturally avoids null pointers.  
• Binary Search functions validate inputs, e.g., checking for null arrays in C, throwing exceptions in TypeScript, and raising TypeError in Python when appropriate.

Overall, each implementation demonstrates sufficient error handling for these examples.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Minor stylistic improvements (e.g., in Python, regex import could be placed at the top of the file rather than inside the function).  
• The TypeScript palindrome checker could also guard against non-string inputs more explicitly, though TypeScript's typing system often makes this unnecessary.  
• C solutions are necessarily more verbose with memory handling, but the current use of malloc/free is correct.  
• In all FizzBuzz implementations, there’s no real need for additional error handling, but that is acceptable given the problem specification.

Despite these small observations, the code is overall robust, clear, and well-structured.

## Graded by: o3-mini-high

Below is a detailed evaluation of each solution by language and problem category:

─────────────────────────────  
TypeScript

• FizzBuzz  
 – Correctness: The loop from 1 to 100 and the chained if/else if conditions work as expected.  
 – Code Quality: The code is clear, commented, and follows standard TypeScript style.  
 – Completeness: The FizzBuzz problem is fully implemented.  
 – Error Handling: No explicit errors needed here since input is hardcoded.

• Palindrome Checker  
 – Correctness: The function correctly cleans the input (lowercase and removes non-alphanumeric characters) and uses a two-pointer approach to compare characters.  
 – Code Quality: The code is well-structured and includes meaningful comments. It also throws an error if null/undefined is passed, which is a reasonable defensive check in TypeScript.  
 – Completeness: Works for all test cases shown.  
 – Error Handling: It throws a descriptive error for invalid input.

• Binary Search  
 – Correctness: The binary search logic (calculating mid, updating left/right pointers) is correct.  
 – Code Quality: The implementation is concise and idiomatic.  
 – Completeness: Covers basic test cases; handles both found and not-found conditions.  
 – Error Handling: Checks if the input is an array and throws an error if not.

─────────────────────────────  
Python

• FizzBuzz  
 – Correctness: The range and conditions are correctly implemented.  
 – Code Quality: The code is clean, uses a docstring, and follows Python conventions.  
 – Completeness: Fully implemented and tested via the __main__ guard.  
 – Error Handling: Not required here; the simplicity of the problem makes it acceptable.

• Palindrome Checker  
 – Correctness: The use of regex to strip non-alphanumeric characters, the lowercasing, and the two-pointer comparison are correct.  
 – Code Quality: The code is well commented and follows proper Python style (PEP8).  
 – Completeness: All cases including empty strings are correctly handled.  
 – Error Handling: The function raises a TypeError if the input isn’t a string, which is good practice.

• Binary Search  
 – Correctness: The function correctly calculates the mid-point and navigates the sorted list to find the target.  
 – Code Quality: It includes a docstring and uses type hints, making it very readable.  
 – Completeness: It covers all basic conditions (target found, target not found).  
 – Error Handling: It ensures the input is a list and raises an error otherwise.

─────────────────────────────  
Rust

• FizzBuzz  
 – Correctness: The use of the inclusive range (1..=100) and if/else blocks produces the correct FizzBuzz output.  
 – Code Quality: The code is idiomatic, with clear function separation.  
 – Completeness: Fully implemented and easy to follow.  
 – Error Handling: No explicit error handling is needed for this task.

 – Completeness: The FizzBuzz problem is fully implemented.  
 – Error Handling: Checks are not necessary for this specific task; the code functions as expected.

• Palindrome Checker  
 – Correctness: The function first checks for NULL input, then creates a cleaned copy of the string (lowercase and filtered for alphanumeric characters) before performing the palindrome check.  
 – Code Quality: While manual memory allocation is necessary in C, the code correctly frees memory and documents each step.  
 – Completeness: All cases, including an empty “cleaned” string, are handled.  
 – Error Handling: It prints an error and returns false when the input is NULL or if memory allocation fails, which is good given the language limitations.

• Binary Search  
 – Correctness: The logic correctly handles binary search in a sorted integer array.  
 – Code Quality: The code is clear with proper checks for NULL pointers and non-positive sizes.  
 – Completeness: It returns the index when the target is found and –1 otherwise, and includes test cases in the main function.  
 – Error Handling: Checks if the input array is NULL and for valid size, printing errors appropriately.
