    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log('Buzz');
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}

// 2) Palindrome Checker
function isPalindrome(str: string): boolean {
  const cleanStr = str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
  const reversedStr = cleanStr.split('').reverse().join('');
  return cleanStr === reversedStr;
}

// 3) Binary Search
function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```

def fizz_buzz():
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return -1
```

        } else if i % 5 == 0 {
            println!("Buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", i);
        }
    }
}

// 2) Palindrome Checker
fn is_palindrome(s: &str) -> bool {
    let clean_str: String = s
        .chars()
        .filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric())
        .flat_map(|c| c.to_lowercase())
        .collect();
    clean_str == clean_str.chars().rev().collect::<String>()
}

    let mut left = 0;
    let mut right = arr.len() - 1;

    while left <= right {
        let mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if arr[mid] == target {

        } else {
            printf("%d\n", i);
        }
    }
}

// 2) Palindrome Checker
bool is_palindrome(const char* s) {
    int len = strlen(s);
    char clean_str[len + 1];
    int j = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        if (isalnum(s[i])) {
            clean_str[j++] = tolower(s[i]);
        }
    }
    clean_str[j] = '\0';

    int start = 0;
    int end = j - 1;

    while (start < end) {
        if (clean_str[start] != clean_str[end]) {
            return false;
        }
        start++;
        end--;
    }

    return true;
}

// 3) Binary Search
int binary_search(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = size - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {

        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

### TypeScript

1. **Correctness**: The implementations for FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search are correct. They function as expected and do not exhibit any bugs or logic errors.

2. **Code Quality**: The TypeScript code follows language conventions well, utilizing appropriate naming conventions, spacing, and comment styles. It is well-structured and easy to read.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented completely in TypeScript.

4. **Error Handling**: There is minimal error handling in this implementation. The Binary Search function assumes that the input is a sorted array without validation.

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Consider adding checks for input validation, especially in the Binary Search function.
- Including return types in the FizzBuzz function would improve clarity, although it is conventional to use `void` in this case.

### Grade: A

---

### Python

1. **Correctness**: The implementations for FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search are correct. They behave as intended without logic errors.

2. **Code Quality**: The Python code is clean and adheres to the PEP 8 style guide. Variable names are descriptive, and there are good use of whitespace and comments.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are fully implemented in Python.

4. **Error Handling**: There is some lack of input validation, especially in the Binary Search function, which assumes that the input list is sorted.

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Add validation checks in the Binary Search function for valid input conditions.
- Consider type hinting for parameters in functions for clearer documentation.

### Grade: A

---

### Rust

1. **Correctness**: The Rust implementations for all three problems are correct and function appropriately without bugs.

2. **Code Quality**: The code follows Rust's conventions well, including naming and formatting. It uses type annotations correctly, and the logic is clean.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are fully implemented in Rust.

4. **Error Handling**: The Binary Search function returns an `Option`, which is a good practice for handling the possibility of not finding the target value.

**Areas for Improvement**:
- While the error handling is good, there’s an implicit assumption that the input slice is sorted when passed to Binary Search. It could be useful to document this requirement for the function.

### Grade: A

---

### C

1. **Correctness**: The implementations for FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search generally work as expected. However, the Palindrome Checker assumes a fixed-length array for `clean_str`, which could lead to buffer overflow if the input string is very long.

2. **Code Quality**: The code follows basic C conventions, but it could be more readable. For instance, it lacks comments, and there could be more appropriate use of constants for the maximum length of strings.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented, so the completeness criterion is met.

4. **Error Handling**: The current implementations lack robust error handling—for example, the Palindrome Checker does not handle very long strings properly and could lead to undefined behavior.

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Use dynamic memory allocation for `clean_str` to handle varying input string lengths safely.
- Add error handling to check if `malloc` fails when dynamically allocating memory.
- Provide comments to improve code comprehensibility.

### Grade: B

- **Error Handling**: None; it simply prints to console which is fine for this context.

**Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: Correct. It cleans the string and properly checks for palindrome.
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured, uses regex for cleaning which is effective.
- **Completeness**: All necessary features implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No error handling, but for such a simple problem, it’s acceptable.

**Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: Works correctly, returns the correct index or -1 if not found.
- **Code Quality**: Good readability and follows TypeScript conventions.
- **Completeness**: Implementation lacks any handling for an unordered array or duplicate elements.
- **Error Handling**: There's no input validation which could lead to issues with unsorted arrays.

**Assessment**: 
- The functions could benefit from typing the return values explicitly for better clarity.
- There's no handling for invalid input (like non-integers in `binarySearch`).
- Documentation comments would improve readability and maintainability.

### TypeScript

1. **Correctness**: All three implementations are correct and function as expected.
   - FizzBuzz works perfectly.
   - The Palindrome Checker properly cleans the string and checks for symmetry.
   - Binary Search correctly finds the index of the target or returns `-1`.

2. **Code Quality**: The code is clean, follows TypeScript conventions, and uses type annotations (`string`, `number`, etc.) appropriately. It avoids unnecessary complexity, and the logic is well-structured. However, there is an opportunity to add type annotations to more variables (e.g., `mid` in `binarySearch`) for consistency.
   
3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling is implemented, but the code assumes valid inputs (e.g., a sorted array for binary search). Adding validation for null or invalid inputs could improve robustness.

- **Suggestions**: 
  - Add type annotations for all local variables.
  - Add error handling for edge cases, such as empty arrays in binary search.

```
Grade: A-
```

---

### Python

1. **Correctness**: The code is correct and works as expected.
   - FizzBuzz is implemented correctly.
   - The Palindrome Checker uses a generator expression to clean the string and reverse-checks correctly.
   - Binary Search operates correctly on sorted arrays.

2. **Code Quality**: The code is clean and follows PEP 8 conventions. However, the function names and variable names could use underscores for better readability (e.g., `binary_search` vs. `binarySearch`). The generator expression in `is_palindrome` is concise but may confuse less experienced developers.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., a sorted array for binary search). Adding checks for edge cases like empty arrays or invalid types would improve robustness.

- **Suggestions**:
  - Add input validation for edge cases (e.g., empty arrays, non-list inputs).
  - Consider adding docstrings to clarify the purpose and usage of each function.

```
Grade: A-
```

---

### Rust

1. **Correctness**: All three implementations are correct and functional.
   - FizzBuzz works as expected.
   - The Palindrome Checker correctly cleans the string using iterators and checks for symmetry.
   - Binary Search operates correctly with a return type of `Option<usize>` for better error handling (returning `None` if the target is not found).

2. **Code Quality**: The code follows Rust conventions well. Use of iterators (`filter`, `flat_map`) makes the Palindrome Checker concise and Rust-like. However, the function names are not in `snake_case`, which is the recommended style for Rust.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: The use of `Option<usize>` in Binary Search is excellent for handling missing values. However, the code assumes the input array is sorted and does not validate it.

- **Suggestions**:
  - Use `snake_case` for function names.
  - Add validation for edge cases, such as empty arrays in binary search.

```
Grade: A
```

---

### C

1. **Correctness**: The code is correct and works as expected.
   - FizzBuzz operates correctly.
   - The Palindrome Checker correctly filters alphanumeric characters and checks for symmetry.
   - Binary Search operates correctly on sorted arrays.

2. **Code Quality**: The code is well-structured and follows C conventions, but there are some areas for improvement.
   - The Palindrome Checker uses raw string manipulation, which works but could be made safer and more efficient with string library functions.
   - Using `stdio.h` for input/output is fine, but the function could benefit from comments or additional documentation.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., a sorted array for binary search). Adding checks for edge cases like empty arrays or invalid types would improve robustness.

- **Suggestions**:
  - Add input validation for edge cases (e.g., empty arrays, invalid types).
  - Consider using safer string-handling functions like `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`.

```
Grade: B+
```

### Overall Summary

- **TypeScript**: A- for missing type annotations and error handling.
- **Python**: A- for edge case handling and naming conventions.
- **Rust**: A for excellent error handling and idiomatic code.
- **C**: B+ for basic functionality but room for improvement in edge case handling and safety.

# Programming Solutions Evaluation

## TypeScript Implementation

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct. It properly outputs "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both, and the number otherwise.

**Code Quality**: The code is clean, readable, and follows TypeScript conventions. The conditional logic is well-organized.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable as this function doesn't take any inputs that could cause errors.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies palindromes by removing non-alphanumeric characters, converting to lowercase, and comparing with its reverse.

**Code Quality**: Well-structured and efficient. The regex pattern removal followed by string manipulation is idiomatic in TypeScript.

**Error Handling**: The function assumes the input is a string. TypeScript's type system would catch non-string inputs at compile time, but there's no runtime type checking.

### 3. Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct. It properly returns the index of the target if found, or -1 otherwise.

**Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and follows TypeScript conventions.

**Error Handling**: The function assumes the input array is sorted, but doesn't verify this. It handles the not-found case appropriately with a -1 return.

**TypeScript Overall**: All three problems are correctly implemented with good code quality. The code benefits from TypeScript's static typing but could use more explicit error handling for robust production use.

```
Grade: A-
```

## Python Implementation

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct, using Python's inclusive-exclusive range syntax to iterate from 1 to 100.

**Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and follows Python conventions (PEP 8).

**Error Handling**: Not applicable as the function doesn't take any inputs that could cause errors.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies palindromes using a clean, Pythonic approach.

**Code Quality**: Excellent use of Python's list comprehension, string slicing, and join operations.

**Error Handling**: The function assumes the input is a string-like object. It would raise an AttributeError if called with non-string types like numbers.

### 3. Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct. It properly returns the index of the target if found, or -1 otherwise.

**Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and follows Python conventions.

**Error Handling**: The function assumes the input array is sorted and doesn't check for empty arrays, which would still work correctly but could be more explicitly handled.

**Python Overall**: All three problems are correctly implemented with excellent Pythonic code quality. The code could benefit from type hints and more robust error handling.

```
Grade: A-
```

## Rust Implementation

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct, using Rust's inclusive range syntax `1..=100`.

**Code Quality**: Well-structured and follows Rust conventions.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable as the function doesn't take any inputs that could cause errors.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies palindromes.

**Code Quality**: The code is well-structured and uses Rust's functional approach appropriately. The chaining of methods is idiomatic Rust.

**Error Handling**: The function assumes the input is a valid UTF-8 string, which is checked by Rust's type system.

### 3. Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct. It returns `Some(index)` when the target is found and `None` otherwise, which is idiomatic Rust.

**Code Quality**: The code follows Rust conventions and uses the Option type appropriately for the return value.

**Error Handling**: There's a potential issue if the array is empty, as `arr.len() - 1` could cause an underflow panic since `usize` is unsigned. This should be checked at the start of the function.

**Rust Overall**: All three problems are implemented with good adherence to Rust conventions. The binary search function has a potential issue with empty arrays that should be addressed.

```
Grade: B+
```

## C Implementation

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct.

**Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and follows C conventions.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable as the function doesn't take any inputs that could cause errors.

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies palindromes.

**Code Quality**: The code is well-structured and follows C conventions. The approach of checking from both ends is efficient.

**Error Handling**: Several issues:
- No NULL check for the input string
- Using a variable-length array (`char clean_str[len + 1]`) is a C99 feature not supported in all C environments
- Potential stack overflow for very long input strings

### 3. Binary Search
**Correctness**: The implementation is correct.

**Code Quality**: Well-structured and follows C conventions.

**Error Handling**: Several issues:
- No check for NULL array or invalid size
- Potential integer overflow in `(left + right) / 2` for very large arrays; should use `left + (right - left) / 2`

**C Overall**: While all three problems are correctly implemented, there are significant concerns with error handling and edge cases, particularly in the palindrome checker and binary search functions.

```
Grade: B-
```

## Completeness Assessment
All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) are implemented in all four languages, satisfying the completeness requirement.

   - **Binary Search**: The function works correctly and returns `-1` if the element isn't found.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - The code follows C conventions, including the use of pointer arithmetic and `const` for strings in `is_palindrome`.
   - However, the palindrome checker allocates a `clean_str` buffer manually, which could fail for very large strings (not dynamically allocated).
   - The structure is clear, but the code is a little more verbose compared to other languages, which is expected in C.

3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems are implemented and functioning correctly.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The palindrome checker does not handle memory bounds errors in `clean_str` dynamically. This could cause potential issues if the input string is too long, leading to buffer overflow (this is typical for C code).
   - Similarly, binary search does not check whether the input array is sorted, though the function expects sorted data.

**C Grade: B+**

### Overall Grade

All implementations are functional and relatively well-written, but the Rust implementation stands out due to its elegant use of idiomatic Rust features, particularly handling `Option` results in `binary_search`.

Okay, let's evaluate the provided code based on the specified criteria.

**TypeScript**

*   **Correctness**: All three functions (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) appear to be logically correct and produce the expected output.
*   **Code Quality**:  The code is well-structured, readable, and follows TypeScript conventions. Type annotations are used appropriately.  Using `Math.floor` in the binary search is good practice.
*   **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling**: The Palindrome Checker handles non-alphanumeric characters appropriately. Binary search returns -1 if the element is not found which is a standard way to indicate failure.  No explicit error handling is present (e.g., checking for null or undefined input for binary search), but it's not strictly required for this problem.

**Python**

*   **Correctness**:  FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search all function as intended.
*   **Code Quality**:  The code is clean, readable, and Pythonic. List comprehension in the Palindrome Checker (`''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())`) is a good concise way to clean the string. Integer division `//` is used to avoid floating point division, making it cleaner than the TypeScript version.
*   **Completeness**:  All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling**:  Palindrome Checker correctly handles non-alphanumeric characters. Binary search returns -1 when element isn't found, standard practice. Similar to TypeScript, no explicit error handling for potentially invalid input (e.g., None for binary_search) is present.

**Rust**

*   **Correctness**:  The FizzBuzz and Palindrome Checker implementations are correct. The Binary Search returns an `Option<usize>` which is good form in Rust. This forces the caller to handle the case when the element isn't found, increasing reliability.
*   **Code Quality**: Good usage of Rust idioms like `Option` for binary search return value. The Palindrome Checker uses iterators and `flat_map` which is a good, albeit potentially less intuitive, approach. Overall the code is well-structured and idiomatic.  Using `collect::<String>()` clarifies the type. The Rust implementation is slightly more modern and safe than the other languages, requiring the return type of binary_search to be handled.
*   **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling**:  The Binary Search returns an `Option<usize>`, which is *much* better error handling than the other languages' approaches. It forces the caller to explicitly deal with the 'not found' case. The Palindrome checker efficiently handles non-alphanumeric.

**C**

*   **Correctness**: All three functions work correctly. The binary search does not account for size=0; this could be corrected with an early return of -1.
*   **Code Quality**: The code is functional, but there's room for improvement. Using `strlen` to find the initial length of the string *and* then making a fixed-size buffer on the stack can be problematic with very long input strings.  This could easily lead to a buffer overflow (although unlikely given the context of example strings).  A safer approach would be to dynamically allocate the `clean_str` buffer. The code in `is_palindrome()` isn't terrible, but relatively verbose compared to the equivalent implementations in other languages.
*   **Completeness**:  All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling**: The Palindrome Checker may fail if the input string is exceptionally long to trigger a stack overflow when the string `clean_str` exceeds the stack memory limit. The Binary Search assumes a well-formed array as input and doesn't validate parameters. A null or empty array is not handled gracefully. It should return -1 if passed 0 as size.

**TypeScript**

1. **Correctness:** All functions appear correct and produce expected outputs.
2. **Code Quality:** Good. Follows TypeScript conventions, type annotations used effectively, and code is readable.
3. **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.
4. **Error Handling:**  `binarySearch` implicitly handles the "not found" case by returning -1. Could explicitly check for empty input array.

**Python**

1. **Correctness:** All functions are correct.
2. **Code Quality:** Good. Pythonic code, clear variable names, and follows PEP 8 guidelines.
3. **Completeness:** All three problems implemented.
4. **Error Handling:** No explicit error handling but functions handle edge cases (e.g., empty string for palindrome, target not found in binary search).

**Rust**

1. **Correctness:** Correct implementations for all problems.
2. **Code Quality:** Excellent. Leverages Rust's type system and functional features effectively, resulting in concise and safe code. `binary_search` returns an `Option` which is excellent practice.
3. **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.
4. **Error Handling:**  Rust's `Option` type in `binary_search` handles the absence of a value very well.

**C**

1. **Correctness:** Functions work as intended.
2. **Code Quality:** Generally good, but the `is_palindrome` function has a potential buffer overflow issue.  `clean_str` is allocated based on the original string length, which might not be sufficient if the string contains many non-alphanumeric characters. This needs to be fixed.
3. **Completeness:**  All three problems are implemented.
4. **Error Handling:**  The `binary_search` function returns -1 if the element is not found, which is standard practice.  However, the `is_palindrome` function could benefit from more robust error handling in case of unexpected input.  Most critically, the buffer overflow possibility is a severe issue.

**TypeScript**

**TypeScript**  
- **Correctness**: All functions work as expected. FizzBuzz handles all cases, palindrome checks appropriately, and binary search is correctly implemented.  
- **Code Quality**: Follows conventions, but FizzBuzz uses side effects (direct `console.log`), and some style inconsistencies (missing semicolons).  
- **Error Handling**: Minimal error checks needed; handles edge cases (e.g., empty strings for palindromes).  

**Python**  
- **Correctness**: Perfect implementations for all problems.  
- **Code Quality**: Clean, idiomatic Python (PEP8 compliant), though `is_palindrome` could use a more descriptive parameter name.  
- **Error Handling**: Relies on input sanitization within functions.  

**Rust**  
- **Correctness**: **Binary search** mid-calculation risks integer overflow (`(left + right) / 2` should use `left + (right - left) / 2`).  
- **Code Quality**: Idiomatic except for binary search flaw.  
- **Error Handling**: Returns `Option` type appropriately, but overflow could cause crashes.  

**C**  
- **Correctness**:  
  - **Binary search** uses `int` for indices, risking overflow with large arrays.  
  - **Palindrome** uses a VLA (variable-length array) for cleaned strings, which can cause stack overflows.  
- **Code Quality**: Indices should use `size_t` instead of `int`.  
- **Error Handling**: No protection against extremely large inputs for palindromes.

## Graded by: o1

Below is a detailed assessment of each language solution, followed by an overall letter grade.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TypeScript
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Correctness
   • FizzBuzz logic is correct: it prints “FizzBuzz” for multiples of 3 and 5, “Fizz” for multiples of 3, and “Buzz” for multiples of 5.  
   • Palindrome checker correctly removes non-alphanumeric characters, lowercases them, and compares against the reversed string.  
   • Binary search correctly returns the index of the target or -1 if not found, using the standard while (left <= right) pattern.

2) Code Quality
   • The functions use clear, descriptive names, appropriate TypeScript syntax, and adhere to typical camelCase conventions.  
   • The palindrome function is succinct and follows good TypeScript string manipulation patterns.  
   • Overall code is readable and follows standard best practices.

3) Completeness
   • All three functions (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) are present.

4) Error Handling
   • No explicit error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., an empty array for binarySearch), though returning -1 is standard behavior when the target is not found.  
   • For typical use cases, the functions behave as expected without throwing errors.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Python
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Correctness
   • FizzBuzz prints the correct strings based on divisibility by 3 and 5.  
   • Palindrome checker uses a clean string approach and a reverse slice (clean_str[::-1]) to verify palindromes accurately.  
   • Binary search adheres to a correct mid-point calculation (left + right) // 2 and returns the correct index or -1.

2) Code Quality
   • Uses Pythonic idioms (e.g., list comprehensions, clean_str[::-1]).  
   • Readable function names and good structure.  
   • Follows conventional Python styling.

3) Completeness
   • All three required functions are implemented.

4) Error Handling
   • No major error handling for empty arrays or strings, but these cases would either return -1 or True/False appropriately in typical usage.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Rust
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Correctness
   • FizzBuzz uses the standard loop from 1..=100, handling multiples of 3 and 5 correctly.  
   • Palindrome checker filters out non-alphanumeric characters, lowercases them, and compares to its reverse correctly.  
   • Binary search returns Some(index) or None, with a proper loop condition (while left <= right).

2) Code Quality
   • Leverages Rust’s iterators and collection methods neatly in the palindrome checker.  
   • Binary search uses Option<usize>, a standard Rust approach.  
   • Readable, concise code, typically idiomatic.

3) Completeness
   • All three problems are covered.

4) Error Handling
   • By returning Option<usize> for binary_search, the code naturally handles “not found” scenarios without panicking.  
   • FizzBuzz and palindrome checker are straightforward and do not need extensive error handling for these demos.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
C
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Correctness
   • FizzBuzz checks multiples of 3 and 5 correctly, printing “FizzBuzz”, “Fizz”, or “Buzz”.  
   • Palindrome checker builds a cleaned lowercase string and compares from both ends until mismatch or end—standard logic.  
   • Binary search finds the target using (left + right) / 2 or returns -1 if not found.

2) Code Quality
   • Straightforward, procedural style, typical for C.  
   • The palindrome checker creates a temporary buffer (clean_str) with sufficient size (len + 1). For very large strings this might be a stack concern, but for typical examples it is acceptable.

3) Completeness
   • All three solutions are present.

4) Error Handling
   • These functions do not handle invalid array sizes (like size = 0) or null pointers, which is common in raw C.  
   • For typical inputs, the code works without crashing.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Assessment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Correctness: All implementations appear logically sound.  
• Code Quality: Code in each language generally follows conventional styling and structure. Minor potential improvements (e.g., more robust error handling, edge-case handling) could be added, but the solutions are still clean and understandable.  
• Completeness: All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) are present in each language.  
• Error Handling: Minimal defensive checks are in place, but for demonstration examples, they are sufficient.

Grade: A-

**Letter Grade:** A-

## Graded by: o3-mini-high

Below is the detailed evaluation for each language:

─────────────────────────────  
TypeScript

• FizzBuzz  
 – The loop correctly checks if i is divisible by both 3 and 5 (or one of them) and prints accordingly. It works as expected.  
   
• Palindrome Checker  
 – The function “isPalindrome” cleans the string (removing non-alphanumerics, converting all to lowercase), reverses it, and compares. It is correct and concise.  
   
• Binary Search  
 – The iterative binary search is implemented correctly. It calculates the middle index and adjusts the left/right bounds as expected.  
   
• Code Quality & Error Handling  
 – The code is clear, uses proper TypeScript conventions, and is structured neatly. While there isn’t explicit error handling (for example, what if the input array wasn’t sorted or was empty), that is typical for a demonstration of binary search.  
   
• Completeness  
 – All three problems are implemented.

─────────────────────────────  
Python

• FizzBuzz  
 – The fizz_buzz function correctly handles numbers 1 through 100 and prints “Fizz”, “Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz” according to divisibility.  

• Palindrome Checker  
 – The function cleans the string by filtering alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase, then compares to the reversed string. It meets the requirements.  

• Binary Search  
 – The binary_search function uses a clear loop with correct index arithmetic. It returns the correct index if found, or –1 if not found.  

• Code Quality & Error Handling  
 – The code is very readable and follows Python conventions. It could benefit from type annotations (using type hints) for improved clarity, but overall error handling (and assumptions about valid inputs) is acceptable given the scope.  

• Completeness  
 – All three problems are implemented.

─────────────────────────────  
Rust

• FizzBuzz  
 – The FizzBuzz implementation iterates from 1 to 100 using an inclusive range, and correctly prints the required strings.  

• Palindrome Checker  
 – The function “is_palindrome” uses iterator adaptors to filter and lowercase the characters, then checks against the reversed version. This is both concise and correct.  

• Binary Search  
 – The binary_search function is implemented in a standard way and returns Option<usize>. However, there is a subtle flaw:  
  – It initializes “right” as arr.len() – 1 without checking whether the slice is empty. In the case of an empty array, this subtraction can underflow.  
  – Improvement: Add a check at the beginning (e.g., if arr.is_empty() { return None; }).  

• Code Quality & Error Handling  
 – The Rust code is idiomatic and well-structured. The minor issue with handling an empty array in binary_search is the only real drawback.  

• Completeness  
 – All three problems are implemented.

─────────────────────────────  
C

• FizzBuzz  
 – The fizz_buzz function uses a standard for-loop and correctly prints “Fizz,” “Buzz,” or “FizzBuzz” based on divisibility.  

• Palindrome Checker  
 – The is_palindrome function creates a “clean” version of the input string (removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting them to lowercase) and then checks by comparing characters from the start and end. It is correct.  
  – Note: It uses a variable-length array (VLA) for clean_str. This technique is acceptable in C99 but might affect portability.  

• Binary Search  
 – The binary_search function implements the iterative search correctly, returning the index when the target is found and –1 otherwise.  

• Code Quality & Error Handling  
 – The code follows conventional C practices and is neatly structured. Although it doesn’t check for some possible edge cases (like NULL strings for the palindrome checker), that is typical for small example programs.  
  – For a production-level program, additional error handling (e.g., validating pointers) might be needed.  

• Completeness  
 – All three problems are implemented.

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Assessment

All four languages provide complete and largely correct solutions for FizzBuzz, a Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search. The implementations are typically structured according to language conventions and demonstrate clear, straightforward logic.

Areas for improvement include:
 – In Rust, the binary_search function should check for an empty array to avoid underflow.
 – In Python, adding type hints could enhance clarity.
 – In C, while the use of VLAs works in C99, considering portability and additional error checking (such as NULL pointer validation) would be beneficial.

Despite these minor issues, the overall quality is high across the board.
