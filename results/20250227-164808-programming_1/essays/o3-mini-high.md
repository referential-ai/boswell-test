    let output = "";
    if (i % 3 === 0) output += "Fizz";
    if (i % 5 === 0) output += "Buzz";
    console.log(output || i);
  }
}

// Palindrome Checker:
// This function ignores case and non-alphanumeric characters.
function isPalindrome(s: string): boolean {
  const filtered: string = s.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, "");
  const reversed: string = filtered.split("").reverse().join("");
  return filtered === reversed;
}

// Binary Search:
// Iteratively search for target in a sorted array.
// Returns the index or -1 if target is not found.
function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
  let low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
    else if (arr[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
    else high = mid - 1;
  }
  return -1;
}

// Main function to run tests.
function main(): void {
  console.log("FizzBuzz:");
  fizzBuzz();

  const testString = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama";
  console.log("\nPalindrome Checker for:", `"${testString}"`);
  console.log("Is palindrome?", isPalindrome(testString));

   - All three problems are included and implemented correctly.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling is present for memory allocation and invalid inputs, which is appropriate in C.

##### Areas for Improvement:
- Memory handling for the filtered string allocation should include error checking.
- More descriptive error messages and input validation can enhance reliability.
- The `isPalindrome` function can use better error handling if `malloc` fails, such as returning an error code.

Overall, the provided implementation in each language is strong and meets most criteria for correctness, quality, and completeness. However, there is room for minor improvements in some cases.

### TypeScript Implementation

#### 1. **Correctness**:
- **FizzBuzz**: Correct. Properly applies `Fizz`, `Buzz`, and `FizzBuzz` rules for each number from 1 to 100.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Correctly handles case-insensitive strings by filtering out non-alphanumeric characters and reverting the string.
- **Binary Search**: Correctly implements the iterative binary search in a sorted array. Handles the edge case for not finding the element.

#### 2. **Code Quality**:
- Code follows TypeScript conventions with clear and readable names.
- Use of `const` and `let` where appropriate.
- No unnecessary repetition.
- Binary search properly handles integer division with `Math.floor`.

#### 3. **Completeness**:
- All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) are implemented correctly.

#### 4. **Error Handling**:
- Binary search assumes `arr` is sorted, but there's no validation for this, which could silently fail. A minor issue, but worth mentioning.
- Palindrome function could do additional checks for empty or null input, but the function works as intended.

```
Grade: A-
```

---

### Python Implementation

#### 1. **Correctness**:
- **FizzBuzz**: Correct implementation, though it's slightly verbose by handling each condition separately.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Correctly removes non-alphanumeric characters and converts the string to lowercase before comparison.
- **Binary Search**: Implements a classic iterative binary search, functioning as expected.

#### 2. **Code Quality**:
- Pythonic readability is good; however, the `elif` chain in the FizzBuzz could be simplified by first appending to an `output` string like the other implementations.
- The binary search function is clear but could benefit from a more descriptive name like `iterative_binary_search`.

#### 3. **Completeness**:
- All three problems are implemented in Python.

#### 4. **Error Handling**:
- Binary search assumes the input list is sorted but does not check this explicitly.
- `fizz_buzz` function prints directly to `stdout` without flexibility for returning results. Ideally, the function could return an iterable instead.

```
Grade: A-
```

---

### Rust Implementation

#### 1. **Correctness**:
- **FizzBuzz**: Correctly handles all cases and prints the right strings or numbers.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Correctly filters non-alphanumeric characters and normalizes case before checking if the string equals its reverse.
- **Binary Search**: Correct, but the `if mid == 0 { break; }` section seems unnecessary since the condition `low <= high` should prevent underflow. Also, returning `mid as i32` seems unnecessary as Rust supports usize.

#### 2. **Code Quality**:
- Rust code follows idiomatic conventions.
- The use of iterators for palindrome filtering is elegant.
- However, the binary search could avoid unnecessary checks (like `if mid == 0`).

#### 3. **Completeness**:
- All three problems are implemented, and the implementation uses idiomatic Rust practices.

#### 4. **Error Handling**:
- Good error prevention by checking `if arr.is_empty()` at the start of `binary_search`.
- No explicit handling for malformed inputs (e.g., non-UTF-8 strings in Palindrome).

```
Grade: A
```

---

### C Implementation

#### 1. **Correctness**:
- **FizzBuzz**: Correctly prints "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" for all appropriate values.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Correctly handles ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and performing case-insensitive comparisons.
- **Binary Search**: Correctly performs the iterative binary search algorithm. Handles cases where the `target` is not found with `-1`.

#### 2. **Code Quality**:
- Code follows common C practices but could benefit from reducing duplication in `fizzBuzz` by using a buffer for results instead of multiple `printf` calls.
- Memory handling in the palindrome checker is correct, but manually handling memory makes the program more vulnerable to errors.
- The use of global `stderr` output improves error messaging.

#### 3. **Completeness**:
- All three problems are implemented correctly.

#### 4. **Error Handling**:
- **Palindrome Checker**: Handles `NULL` strings and checks for `malloc` failure gracefully.
- **Binary Search**: Checks for `NULL` array or invalid `size`, printing a helpful message to `stderr`.
- **FizzBuzz**: No issues.

```
Grade: B+
```

---

### Overall Assessment

- **TypeScript**: Well-crafted and follows conventions closely. Minimal issues related to input assumptions and error handling lead to a strong `A-` grade.
  
- **Python**: Very readable with idiomatic constructs but slightly verbose with `FizzBuzz` handling, leading to a grade of `A-`.

- **Rust**: Very idiomatic; however, the binary search has a couple of minor redundant checks. Overall, it's an `A` implementation.

- **C**: Handles manual memory management well, which is tricky in C. Error handling is solid, but some verbose code can be cleaned up. This results in a `B+` grade.

```
Grade: A-
```

Okay, I will evaluate the provided code solutions based on the specified criteria.

**TypeScript Implementation:**

1.  **Correctness**: All three functions (FizzBuzz, isPalindrome, binarySearch) appear to be functionally correct based on a code review.
2.  **Code Quality**: The code adheres to TypeScript conventions.  Type annotations are used appropriately. The `use strict";` statement is present which is a great, old-school way enforce stricter JavaScript parsing.
3.  **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
4.  **Error Handling**: Basic error handling doesn't really apply to these problems within a language runtime like TypeScript, and isn't expected here.  The code is robust in its own way.

**Areas for Improvement (TypeScript):** None. The code is clean and well-written.

**Python Implementation:**

1.  **Correctness**: All three functions are functionally correct.  The palindrome regex is correct.  The integer division `//` is correct.
2.  **Code Quality**: The code is readable and follows Pythonic conventions (PEP 8). Type hints make the code more understandable.
3.  **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
4.  **Error Handling**: Error handling wouldn't necessarily apply in these contexts, and isn't expected, as they are implemented.

**Areas for Improvement (Python):** None. The code is clean and well-written.

**Rust Implementation:**

1.  **Correctness**: All three functions work as expected. The palindrome function correctly filters and compares strings, and the binary search safely avoids potential integer overflow. The empty array edge case is handled.
2.  **Code Quality**: The Rust code is well-structured and follows Rust conventions. The use of `filter`, `flat_map`, and `collect` for the palindrome checker demonstrates idiomatic Rust. The binary search implementation avoids potential integer overflow.
3.  **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
4.  **Error Handling**:  The binary search considers checking for an potentially invalid input.

**Areas for Improvement (Rust):**  None. The code is well written and implemented, idiomatic and performant.

**C Implementation:**

1.  **Correctness**: All three functions work correctly.  The palindrome function correctly filters and compares strings, and handles with allocation and deallocation correctly.  Size checks are correctly performed.
2.  **Code Quality**: The C code is reasonably well-structured and uses standard C libraries appropriately. The `isPalindrome` function correctly allocates and frees memory, preventing memory leaks.
3.  **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.
4.  **Error Handling**: Checks for NULL input and malloc success.

**Areas for Improvement (C):** None. Memory management is correct. The code implements the functions using idiomatic C and handles error detection.

**Overall Grades:**

TypeScript: A+
Python: A+

## Graded by: Gemini Pro 1.5

**TypeScript**

* **Correctness**: The implementations are correct.
* **Code Quality**: Good. Follows TypeScript conventions, uses type annotations effectively, and is well-structured.
* **Completeness**: All three problems implemented.
* **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is present in the binary search (empty array check isn't really needed given how TypeScript works, but it's not harmful).  Could be improved in `isPalindrome` by explicitly handling the case where the input string is null or undefined.

Grade: A

**Python**

* **Correctness**: The implementations are correct.
* **Code Quality**: Good.  Clean, Pythonic code. Type hinting is a plus.
* **Completeness**: All three problems implemented.
* **Error Handling**:  Lacks explicit error handling, especially for edge cases like empty lists in binary search. Relies on Python's dynamic typing and exceptions, which is acceptable in this context but could be improved.

Grade: A-


**Rust**

* **Correctness**: The implementations are mostly correct. The binary search handles the edge cases correctly.
* **Code Quality**:  Generally good. Uses Rust idioms effectively.
* **Completeness**: All three problems implemented.
* **Error Handling**: More robust than Python or TypeScript due to more specific error handling. In many cases, the compiler helps by simply not allowing the incorrect code to compile.
* **Areas for Improvement**: Underflow for mid=0 won't ever happen in the binary search, as it occurs only after the first comparison, where there's no decrement.

Grade: A


**C**

* **Correctness**: Correct implementations.
* **Code Quality**: Good.  Follows C conventions.  The `isPalindrome` function includes a good edge-case test with clear error reporting printed to stderr in `binary_search`.
* **Completeness**: All three problems implemented.
* **Error Handling**: Good.  Explicitly handles `NULL` pointer inputs in `isPalindrome` and `binary_search`, allocates memory safely, and reports errors using `fprintf(stderr, ...)`, which is good practice. Clear error reporting on exceptional conditions for both `isPalindrome` and `binary_search`.
* **Areas for Improvement**:  While the current memory allocation strategy in `isPalindrome` allocates the maximum possible space needed, it could be optimized by performing two passes: The first pass calculates the size of the filtered string, then the second pass allocates the precise amount of memory and creates said filtered string.

Grade: A-

**TypeScript**  
- **Correctness**: All functions are implemented correctly. Edge cases like empty arrays in binary search are handled.  
- **Code Quality**: Clean, follows TypeScript conventions with proper type annotations. Readable and well-structured.  
- **Error Handling**: No errors observed; handles empty arrays implicitly in `binarySearch`.  

**Python**  
- **Correctness**: Functions behave as expected. FizzBuzz conditions are correct.  
- **Code Quality**: Follows PEP8. The FizzBuzz could use string concatenation for efficiency but is still correct.  
- **Error Handling**: No critical errors; ignores input validation for binary search (handled by convention).  

**Rust**  
- **Correctness**: Safe handling of edge cases (e.g., underflow in binary search).  
- **Code Quality**: Idiomatic, but `binarySearch` returning `i32` (instead of `Option<usize>`) is slightly unidiomatic.  
- **Error Handling**: Robust with checks for empty arrays and underflow prevention.  

**C**  
- **Correctness**: `isPalindrome` returns `false` on memory allocation failure, which could erroneously indicate non-palindromes.  
- **Code Quality**: Uses `int` for array size; `size_t` would be more appropriate. Dynamic allocation in `isPalindrome` works but could be optimized.  
- **Error Handling**: Checks `malloc` failure but propagates incorrect results in such cases.  

**Overall Feedback**:  
Three languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust) exhibit strong correctness and quality. The C implementation has a notable correctness flaw in `isPalindrome` during memory allocation failures and minor code quality issues. This lowers the overall score slightly.  

Grade: A-

### Grades

Based on the evaluation, here are the grades:

**TypeScript Implementation**

Grade: A-

**Python Implementation**

Grade: A

**Rust Implementation**

Grade: A-

**C Implementation**

Grade: A-

### Recommendations
1. **TypeScript**: Ensure that the error handling is more comprehensive, especially in the `binarySearch` function to handle index out of bounds errors explicitly.

2. **Python**: The Python code is quite clean but might benefit from handling `re.sub` exceptions explicitly, although this is less common in typical usage scenarios.

3. **Rust**: The Rust implementation is very strong. It just needs minor improvements in comments and documentation to make it perfect. It handles errors correctly and uses Rust's strengths effectively. For example, adding comments explaining why certain checks are done will improve readability.

4. **C**: The C implementation is robust due to its explicit error handling but may benefit slightly from code comments to explain each step of complex algorithms like the binary search.

## Graded by: o1

Below is a detailed assessment for each language version, followed by an overall grade.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) TypeScript Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Correctness:
  – FizzBuzz prints correctly from 1 to 100 using an if-mod pattern that appends "Fizz" and/or "Buzz" appropriately.  
  – Palindrome checker lowercases the input, strips non-alphanumerics, and compares the string to its reverse. This works reliably for basic ASCII use cases.  
  – Binary search correctly returns the index of the target or -1 if not found, using a standard iterative approach.

• Code Quality:
  – The TypeScript code is generally clear and follows common conventions (e.g., function return types, descriptive function names).  
  – Use of console.log is appropriate for a small demonstration.  
  – One minor enhancement could be to add error checks (e.g., if the array is empty before searching), but for well-formed inputs this is not critical.

• Completeness: All three tasks (FizzBuzz, palindrome, binary search) are present.

• Error Handling:
  – The code does not throw errors or handle invalid arguments (e.g., empty arrays) in a formal way, but this is typically acceptable for a simple demonstration.  
  – TypeScript’s type annotations reduce some potential runtime type issues.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Python Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Correctness:
  – FizzBuzz is split into the usual conditions for "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz"; this is a classic, correct implementation.  
  – Palindrome checker uses a regex to filter out non-alphanumeric characters, converts to lowercase, and checks equality with its reversed string. This is correct.  
  – Binary search employs an iterative pattern with low/high indices and correctly finds or fails to find the target.

• Code Quality:
  – Code is idiomatic Python (e.g., use of slices with [::-1] for reversing, PEP-8 style variable naming).  
  – Could include docstrings, but the overall readability is solid.

• Completeness: All tasks are covered.

• Error Handling:
  – The functions are succinct. As with many lightweight scripts, there is no extensive error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., an empty array).  
  – The palindrome and search behave well for typical cases.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Rust Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Correctness:
  – FizzBuzz uses formatted strings and straightforward loops; it works correctly.  
  – Palindrome checker filters alphanumeric characters via is_alphanumeric, converts to lowercase, and checks equality with its reverse. This is correct.  
  – Binary search checks if the array is empty before searching, then performs a standard iterative search. It also prevents “mid” underflow by breaking if mid == 0 and the target is lower—correctly avoiding an infinite loop.

• Code Quality:
  – Follows standard Rust practices: uses slices, handles empty arrays, returns -1 if not found.  
  – The code is nicely structured, and variable naming is clear.

• Completeness: All three problems are implemented.

• Error Handling:
  – The code returns -1 for not found and for empty arrays. This approach is simple but effective.  
  – In more production-level code, returning a Result or Option might be more idiomatic, but for a small example, the current design is acceptable.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) C Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Correctness:
  – FizzBuzz checks multiple-of-3 and multiple-of-5 with standard if/else logic.  
  – Palindrome checker allocates a temporary buffer, filters alphanumeric characters to lowercase, and does a two-pointer comparison; correct for typical ASCII use.  
  – Binary search does a standard iterative approach with checks for invalid inputs and prints the correct result.

• Code Quality:
  – Straightforward structured C, uses malloc/free for the filtered palindrome check, and checks allocation errors.  
  – Variable naming is clear and code is separated by function, making it readable.

• Completeness: All three tasks are fully present.

• Error Handling:
  – The code warns if memory allocation fails and checks if the array is NULL or size <= 0.  
  – It prints errors to stderr appropriately.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall Observations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• All four implementations handle FizzBuzz, palindrome checking (ignoring non-alphanumeric chars), and binary search in a logically correct way.  
• The code follows typical language conventions for each of TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C.  
• Minimal but reasonable error handling is present, especially given the scope (e.g., checking for empty arrays in Rust and C, memory allocation checks in C).  
• The solutions are consistently structured, making them straightforward to read and maintain.
