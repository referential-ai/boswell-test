### TypeScript

**1) FizzBuzz:**
```typescript
function fizzbuzz(): void {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    let output = '';
    if (i % 3 === 0) output += 'Fizz';
    if (i % 5 === 0) output += 'Buzz';
    console.log(output || i.toString());
  }
}

fizzbuzz();
```

**2) Palindrome Checker:**
```typescript
function isPalindrome(s: string): boolean {
  const cleaned = s.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');
  return cleaned === [...cleaned].reverse().join('');
}

console.log(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // true
console.log(isPalindrome("race a car")); // false
```

**3) Binary Search:**
```typescript
function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
  let low = 0;
  let high = arr.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    const current = arr[mid];
    if (current === target) return mid;
    current < target ? low = mid + 1 : high = mid - 1;
  }
  return -1;
}

# Evaluation of Programming Solutions

## TypeScript

### 1) FizzBuzz
The implementation is correct and follows the FizzBuzz rules properly. The code is clean and easy to understand.

### 2) Palindrome Checker
The implementation is correct. It properly cleans the input string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring case. The solution is elegant and uses built-in TypeScript features appropriately.

### 3) Binary Search
The implementation is correct and will find the target value efficiently. However, there's a potential issue with the conditional expression on line 9 - it would be clearer to use a traditional if/else structure instead of the ternary operator for readability.

Overall, the TypeScript implementations are well-structured and follow language conventions. The error handling is minimal but sufficient for the simplicity of these particular problems.

```
Grade: A-
```

## Python

### 1) FizzBuzz
The implementation is correct and follows Python conventions. It's concise and readable.

### 2) Palindrome Checker
The implementation is correct. It properly uses regex to clean the input and the slice notation for string reversal is an efficient Python-specific approach.

### 3) Binary Search
The implementation is correct and follows standard binary search algorithm logic. The function lacks type hints for the return value, which would improve code quality.

All implementations are well done, though they could benefit from docstrings to explain inputs and outputs. Error handling is minimal but appropriate for these simple algorithms.

```
Grade: A
```

## Rust

### 1) FizzBuzz
The implementation is correct and makes good use of Rust's pattern matching, which is idiomatic for the language.

### 2) Palindrome Checker
The implementation is correct and makes effective use of Rust's iterator methods. It properly filters non-alphanumeric characters.

### 3) Binary Search
The implementation is mostly correct but has a subtle issue - it returns the mid index without considering that it needs to be returned as an index type, not an i32. The function signature returns i32, which works for the negative case (-1) but could be clearer by returning Option<usize> which would be more idiomatic Rust.

Error handling is appropriate for the given tasks, though the binary search function doesn't test the non-existent case in the provided examples.

```
Grade: B+
```

## C

### 1) FizzBuzz
The implementation is correct and follows a clean approach by checking for divisibility by 15 first, which is more efficient than checking 3 and 5 separately.

### 2) Palindrome Checker
The implementation is correct and shows careful memory management with proper allocation and freeing. It properly handles edge cases by checking for failed memory allocation.

### 3) Binary Search
The implementation is correct and uses a safer approach to calculate the midpoint to avoid potential integer overflow. However, it doesn't provide a test case for a missing element like the other language examples do.

The C implementations show good attention to detail regarding memory management and buffer handling. The palindrome checker especially demonstrates good error handling by checking the result of malloc.

```
Grade: A
```

## Overall Assessment

All three problems have been implemented in all four languages. The TypeScript and Python implementations are more concise and take advantage of language features. The C implementations show careful memory management. The Rust implementations are generally idiomatic but could benefit from more idiomatic error handling.

The strongest solutions are in Python and C, with TypeScript very close behind and Rust having a few minor issues with its binary search implementation.

**Letter Grade:** A-
**Numeric Grade:** 3.7

- **Completeness:** Yes, implemented.
- **Error Handling:** There's no error handling for function calls or potential runtime errors.

```typescript
Grade: B+
```

**Palindrome Checker:**
- **Correctness:** Correctly identifies palindromes by ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case.
- **Code Quality:** The function is well-structured, uses modern JavaScript/TypeScript features like spread operator, but could use optional chaining or ternary where appropriate.
- **Completeness:** Yes, implemented.
- **Error Handling:** Doesn't handle for example, null or undefined inputs.

```typescript
Grade: A-
```

**Binary Search:**
- **Correctness:** Correct and works as expected.
- **Code Quality:** Good structuring, but can be optimized to avoid `Math.floor` by using `>>` for integer division or adjusting the midpoint calculation for performance.
- **Completeness:** Yes, implemented.

```typescript
Grade: A-
```

### Python

**FizzBuzz:**

- **Completeness:** Yes, implemented.
- **Error Handling:** None provided.

```python
Grade: B+
```

**Palindrome Checker:**
- **Correctness:** Correct as it accounts for case and non-alphanumeric characters.

- **Completeness:** Yes, implemented.
- **Error Handling:** Lacks checks for invalid inputs or edge cases.

```python
Grade: A-
```

**Binary Search:**
- **Correctness:** The implementation is correct.
- **Code Quality:** Clean and Pythonic. However, `(low + high) // 2` could potentially overflow for very large arrays; consider `(low + high) >> 1` or `low - (low - high) // 2`.
- **Completeness:** Yes, implemented.
- **Error Handling:** No error checks for input parameters or array size.

```python
Grade: A-
```

- **Error Handling:** No checks for empty strings or non-UTF-8 strings.

```rust
Grade: A-
```

**Binary Search:**

Here is my evaluation of the code solutions:

TypeScript:
1. Correctness: The TypeScript implementations are correct and work as expected with no bugs.
2. Code Quality: The code follows TypeScript best practices and is well-structured and readable. Minor suggestions: For fizzbuzz, could use `if/else if` instead of concatenating output string. For binary search, could simplify ternary to `current < target ? low = mid + 1 : high = mid - 1`.  
3. Completeness: All three problems are implemented.
4. Error Handling: No explicit error handling needed.

Python:
1. Correctness: The Python implementations are correct with no logic errors. 
2. Code Quality: The code is Pythonic, concise and follows conventions. Uses appropriate language features like list slicing, string formatting, ternary expressions.
3. Completeness: All three problems are implemented.
4. Error Handling: No error handling issues.

Rust:
1. Correctness: The Rust solutions are correct and bug-free.
2. Code Quality: Idiomatic Rust is used effectively - pattern matching, iterators, standard library. Code is well-structured. Suggestion: `binary_search` could return `Option<usize>` instead of `i32`.
3. Completeness: All three problems are solved. 
4. Error Handling: No issues, although `binary_search` could potentially handle empty array input.

C:
1. Correctness: The C implementations are correct, but have some potential issues (see below).
2. Code Quality: Code is readable but has room for improvement. Suggestions: Use `const` for read-only variables, add more comments.
3. Completeness: All three problems are attempted.
4. Error Handling: The palindrome checker has potential issues with `malloc` error handling - it returns false if allocation fails, which could be misleading. No error handling for potential `NULL` string input.

Overall, the TypeScript, Python and Rust solutions are excellent - correct, idiomatic and complete. The C code is mostly correct but has some quality and robustness concerns.

### Evaluation

---

### **TypeScript**

#### **1) FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Covers both Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz cases correctly.
- **Code Quality**: The function is well-structured. However, `console.log` is directly used in the `fizzbuzz` function, which may make the function harder to reuse. It could instead return an array of results.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling; there are no edge cases in this problem that the function addresses.

#### **2) Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Handles non-alphanumeric characters and is case-insensitive.
- **Code Quality**: Follows TypeScript conventions. The use of `replace` with a regex pattern is clean and concise.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling, but the input type is restricted to a `string`, and the use of `replace` is robust.

#### **3) Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Properly handles standard binary search logic.
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured and uses `Math.floor` for mid-point calculation to avoid floating-point issues.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: The input array is assumed to be sorted. The function does not handle unsorted input and could benefit from documentation indicating this assumption.

**Overall Grade**:
```
Grade: A-
```

---

### **Python**

#### **1) FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Prints the appropriate FizzBuzz output for all cases.
- **Code Quality**: Clean and readable. Similar to TypeScript, it might be better to return the results rather than print directly.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Minimal. There are no exceptional conditions to handle here.

#### **2) Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Properly removes non-alphanumeric characters and checks palindrome with slicing.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, and it uses Pythonic idioms such as slicing and the `re` library efficiently.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: The input type is assumed to be a string but could benefit from type hinting and an assertion.

#### **3) Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Proper implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- **Code Quality**: The function is well-structured and uses integer arithmetic correctly.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Assumes the array is sorted, but no input validation for array sorting or type. A note in the comment or assertion would be helpful.

**Overall Grade**:
```
Grade: A
```

---

### **Rust**

#### **1) FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: Correct. The `match` statement elegantly handles all FizzBuzz cases.
- **Code Quality**: Excellent code quality. It is idiomatic Rust, using pattern matching effectively.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: No need for error handling here since the problem is deterministic.

#### **2) Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Strips out non-alphanumeric characters and checks palindrome efficiently.
- **Code Quality**: Rust idiomatic. Uses `filter`, `map`, and iterator methods effectively.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Input is assumed to be a valid string. Rust ensures type safety here.

#### **3) Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Handles binary search using Rust idioms and pattern matching for comparison.
- **Code Quality**: Excellent. Uses `std::cmp::Ordering` for clarity and safety.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Like in other languages, assumes the input is sorted. Could use better documentation for this assumption.

**Overall Grade**:
```
Grade: A+
```

---

### **C**

#### **1) FizzBuzz**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Uses conditionals appropriately, and the `printf` statements correctly output FizzBuzz.
- **Code Quality**: Code follows C conventions but could benefit from more modularity (e.g., separating logic from output).
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Minimal; no error-prone conditions here.

#### **2) Palindrome Checker**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Handles non-alphanumeric filtering and checks for palindrome conditions correctly.
- **Code Quality**: Clean and follows good memory management practices (`malloc` and `free`). The logic for palindrome checking is robust.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Properly handles memory allocation issues with `malloc`. It could return a status code if memory fails instead of silently returning `false`.

#### **3) Binary Search**
- **Correctness**: Correct. Follows standard binary search logic efficiently.
- **Code Quality**: Good quality, but the binary search implementation is not modular (it's written in `main`). Also, integer overflow in `mid` calculation could be avoided by using `left + (right - left) / 2`, which has been implemented correctly.
- **Completeness**: Implemented.
- **Error Handling**: Assumes the array is sorted. It could use better documentation for input assumptions.

**Overall Grade**:
```
Grade: B+
```

## Graded by: Gemini Pro 1.5

### TypeScript

**1) FizzBuzz:**
Correct, clean, and idiomatic. No issues.

**2) Palindrome Checker:**
Correct and generally well-written.  Could be slightly more efficient by avoiding the creation of the intermediate array with the spread operator.

**3) Binary Search:**
Correct, clear, and concise.

Grade: A

### Python

**1) FizzBuzz:**
Correct, clean, and idiomatic. No issues.

**2) Palindrome Checker:**
Correct and uses the `re` module appropriately. Well-written and readable.

**3) Binary Search:**
Correct and follows Python conventions.  Clear variable names and good use of integer division.

Grade: A

### Rust

**1) FizzBuzz:**
Correct and makes good use of Rust's `match` expression.  Idiomatic and efficient.

**2) Palindrome Checker:**
Correct, clean, and demonstrates functional programming principles effectively.

**3) Binary Search:**
Correct. The use of `match` for comparing is slightly verbose, but acceptable. Could avoid the `mid_idx` variable by using `get()` with an `Option`. Returns `i32` which isn't really necessary; `usize` would be a better alternative for the sake of consistency (though it would require a cast to return -1, as is common practice).

Grade: A-

### C

**1) FizzBuzz:**
Correct and efficient.  Standard C implementation. Could combine the initial condition to check `i % 15 == 0`

**2) Palindrome Checker:**
Correct, but memory management could be improved. It's crucial to check the return value of `malloc` to handle potential allocation failures. Also, the use of `len + 1` suggests an attempt to accommodate a null terminator but there could be a potential off by 1 error, even though the code currently works due to the test cases. Clearer variable names would improve readability (e.g., num_alphanumeric instead of len). The palindrome check itself is well implemented.

**3) Binary Search:**
Correct and efficient. The use of `left + (right - left) / 2` is good practice to prevent potential integer overflow.  The function could benefit from taking the array size as size_t, for consistency.

Grade: B+

2. **Palindrome Checker:**
   - **TypeScript:** The solution correctly checks for palindromes by removing non-alphanumeric characters and comparing characters. It handles case sensitivity and non-alphanumeric characters.
   - **Python:** The solution uses `re.sub` to remove non-alphanumeric characters, converts to lowercase, and checks if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse.
   - **Rust:** The solution correctly cleans up the string by filtering out non-readable characters, converting them to lowercase, and checking if they form a palindrome.
   - **C:** The solution correctly cleans up the string by counting alphabets, allocating space, processing alphanumeric characters, and checking if characters form a palindrome in reverse order.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - **TypeScript:** The solution correctly performs binary search by iteratively halving the search space until finding the target or determining it's absent.
   - **Python:** The solution correctly performs binary search by iteratively halving the search space until finding the target or determining it's absent.

   - **C:** The solution correctly performs binary search by iteratively halving the search space until finding the target or determining it's absent.

#### Code Quality and Readability

1. **FizzBuzz:**
   - **TypeScript:** The code is clear and concise, using a simple `for` loop and conditional statements. Readability is high.
   - **Python:** The code is straightforward with a simple `for` loop and conditional statements. Readability is high.
   - **Rust:** The code is idiomatic Rust, using `match` to handle different cases. It is highly readable.
   - **C:** The code does not use `printf` with format specifiers, making it slightly less readable but still clear.

2. **Palindrome Checker:**
   - **TypeScript:** The code uses descriptive variable names like `cleaned` and follows logical steps. It is readable.
   - **Python (with `re` usage):** The code is concise but relies on the `re` module for cleaning non-alphanumeric characters. It is somewhat readable but may require explanation of regex usage.
   - **Rust (with iterators):** The code is well-structured and uses iterators effectively. It is highly readable.
   - **C (with extensive error handling):** The memory handling and comparison steps are complex, making it less readable compared to other implementations.

3. **Binary Search:**

   - **Rust:** The code uses `match` for comparisons, which is idiomatic Rust, making it highly readable.
   - **C:** The code uses standard integer arithmetic and comparison rules, making it mostly readable but slightly less structured compared to other implementations.

#### Completeness

All implementations provided are complete for each problem statement in their respective languages.

#### Error Handling

1. **FizzBuzz:** No generics errors are handled as they are not necessary.
2. **Palindrome Checker:** TypeScript and Rust handle exceptions by returning Boolean values indicating palindromes. Python uses exceptions implicitly in `re.sub` and string comparison. C does not handle exceptions explicitly but ensures valid memory allocation through checks and allocations.
3. **Binary Search:**
   - All implementations handle exceptions implicitly by returning values indicating presence or absence of the target element: $$-1$$ for absence and an index for presence.

#### Specific Issues or Areas for Improvement

1. **TypeScript (FizzBuzz):**
   - No issues found. The code is correct and well-structured.

2. **Python (FizzBuzz):**
   - No issues found. The code is correct and straightforward.

3. **Rust (FizzBuzz):**
   - No specific issues found, but it could benefit from including min and max range checks for better error handling, though it’s not strictly necessary here.

4. **C (FizzBuzz):**
   - No specific issues found but would be better with clear indentation and line breaks within `if`/else blocks for readability enhancements.

5. **TypeScript (Palindrome Checker):**
   - Handling errors isn’t explicitly needed here as it returns Boolean type correctly indicating palindrome state.

6. **Python (Palindrome Checker):**
   - The use of regular expressions (`re.sub`) might be confusing for beginners without exposure to regex patterns used here.

7. **Rust (Palindrome Checker):**
   - Clear and idiomatic usage ensures good readability.

8. **C (Palindrome Checker):**
    - Complex nature due to manual memory allocation necessitates careful checks which makes readability challenging but is technically sound.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TYPE-SCRIPT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) FizzBuzz  
   • Correctness: The FizzBuzz logic is implemented correctly. It prints "Fizz" if divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both.  
   • Code Quality: The code is straightforward and idiomatic TypeScript/JavaScript. Using console.log(output || i) is a concise approach.  
   • Completeness: The FizzBuzz solution is present and runs up to 100 as expected.  
   • Error Handling: FizzBuzz generally doesn't require robust error handling, and there are no obvious issues here.

2) Palindrome Checker  
   • Correctness: Correctly filters out non-alphanumeric characters using a regular expression, lowercases the remaining string, and compares the reversed string. Works as expected.

## Graded by: o3-mini-high

Below is a detailed evaluation by language:

──────────────────────────────
TypeScript

1) FizzBuzz:
 • Correctness: The loop from 1 to 100 with string concatenation for “Fizz” and “Buzz” works exactly as expected.
 • Code Quality: The code is clean and concise. Using output || i.toString() is an elegant way to decide what to print.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: All is in order for this simple example; error handling isn’t needed here.

2) Palindrome Checker:
 • Correctness: Converting to lowercase, stripping non-alphanumeric characters with a regular expression, and comparing with a reversed spread–array version works correctly.
 • Code Quality: The implementation is clear and uses modern TypeScript features. (One could note that for very long strings a two‐pointer approach might be slightly more efficient, but that is not a requirement here.)
 • Completeness & Error Handling: The use case covers the intended examples; no explicit error handling is required for input strings.

3) Binary Search:
 • Correctness: The iterative binary search properly adjusts low and high and returns the correct index or –1 when not found.
 • Code Quality: The ternary style used to update low/high is a bit terse; an if–else might improve readability for beginners, but it is acceptable.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: The function handles a normal search on a sorted array. No special error handling is needed in the given context.

──────────────────────────────
Python

1) FizzBuzz:
 • Correctness: The range-based loop and checks for multiples work perfectly.
 • Code Quality: The conditional printing (using “output if output else i”) is both readable and Pythonic.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It is complete for the problem, with no need for extra error handling.

2) Palindrome Checker:
 • Correctness: Using the regex to remove non–alphanumeric characters and a simple slice reversal does the job correctly.
 • Code Quality: The function is concise, readable, and follows Python conventions.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: The use of re.sub is appropriate; additional error handling isn’t necessary for string inputs.

3) Binary Search:
 • Correctness: The standard iterative binary search returns the correct index or –1.
 • Code Quality: The code is clear and uses Python’s integer division appropriately.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: The function gracefully returns –1 when the target isn’t found; explicit argument validation isn’t needed for the given examples.

──────────────────────────────
Rust

1) FizzBuzz:
 • Correctness: The use of a range (1..=100) with a match on (i % 3, i % 5) produces the desired output.
 • Code Quality: The code is idiomatic and clear.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: Exception or error handling isn’t needed for this simple case.

2) Palindrome Checker:
 • Correctness: Filtering to keep only ASCII alphanumeric characters, converting to lowercase, and comparing the forward and reverse iterator yields the correct answer.
 • Code Quality: The iterator solution is clean and idiomatic.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It correctly covers the tested cases. (Minor note: If non-ASCII support were desired, additional handling may be needed.)

3) Binary Search:
 • Correctness: The iterative search correctly calculates mid, compares values, and returns –1 for not found.
 • Code Quality: While the algorithm works, note that it converts the slice’s length to i32 and returns an i32, which isn’t the most idiomatic Rust style. Typically one would use usize indices and return an Option<usize> to avoid mixing signed and unsigned types.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: Aside from the stylistic improvement noted above, the implementation meets the requirements. It would be ideal to also test a “not found” case in main.

──────────────────────────────
C

1) FizzBuzz:
 • Correctness: The if–else cascade using the modulus check for 15, 3, and 5 produces the expected output.
 • Code Quality: The code is straightforward and easy to follow.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: For this simple console output, error handling is not applicable.

2) Palindrome Checker:
 • Correctness: The function counts, allocates a processed string, converts characters to lowercase, and performs a two–pointer check correctly.
 • Code Quality: The code is clear, though a bit verbose due to C’s nature. It properly frees allocated memory.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It checks the result of malloc and returns false if allocation fails. While this is basic error handling for C, improvements could include more explicit error messaging or an alternative approach that avoids dynamic allocation for short strings.

3) Binary Search:
 • Correctness: The iterative binary search correctly calculates mid, compares, and returns the proper index or –1.
 • Code Quality: The implementation is standard and clear.
 • Completeness & Error Handling: It covers the basic case. As with the Rust version, it could be enhanced by also including tests for a not–found case.

──────────────────────────────
Overall Assessment

All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) are implemented across four languages. The solutions are correct and follow language–specific conventions while being clear and structured. The implementations are complete for the given tasks, and while none of them include robust error handling (which isn’t overly necessary for these examples), they do check the appropriate conditions (e.g., the C code checks malloc). In Rust, the binary search could be improved by using more idiomatic types (Option<usize> instead of i32 and usize conversions) for a more “Rustacean” solution.

Given the overall quality, correctness, completeness, and minor areas for improvement mainly in idiomatic style (especially in Rust) rather than in functionality, the overall grade is:

Grade: A

**Letter Grade:** A
**Numeric Grade:** 4.0
