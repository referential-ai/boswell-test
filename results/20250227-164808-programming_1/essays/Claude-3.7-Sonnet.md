    }
    
    // Compare the string with its reverse
    const reversedStr = cleanStr.split('').reverse().join('');

**Code Quality**: Excellent. Follows Python conventions with snake_case naming and proper docstrings. The main guard prevents execution when imported.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable for this problem.

### 2. Palindrome Checker in Python
**Correctness**: Correctly identifies palindromes, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.

**Code Quality**: Very good. Uses regular expressions effectively and Python's elegant string reversal syntax.

**Error Handling**: Properly handles None inputs and empty strings.

### 3. Binary Search in Python
**Correctness**: Correctly implements the binary search algorithm.

**Code Quality**: Clean and well-structured with good docstrings.

**Error Handling**: Handles None and empty arrays properly.

**Improvement**: As with TypeScript, it doesn't verify that the input array is sorted.

## Rust Implementations

### 1. FizzBuzz in Rust
**Correctness**: Implements FizzBuzz logic correctly.

**Code Quality**: Clean and idiomatic Rust code. Good use of Rust's range syntax.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable for this problem.

### 2. Palindrome Checker in Rust
**Correctness**: Correctly identifies palindromes, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.

**Code Quality**: Excellent. Uses Rust's functional programming capabilities with filter and map. The implementation compares characters from both ends moving inward, which is efficient.

**Error Handling**: Handles empty strings properly. Null strings aren't a concept in Rust.

### 3. Binary Search in Rust
**Correctness**: Correctly implements binary search.

**Code Quality**: Very good. Uses generics with the Ord trait, allowing it to work with any comparable type.

**Error Handling**: Checks for empty arrays and has a special check to prevent underflow for unsigned types.

**Improvement**: Like other implementations, it assumes the array is sorted.

## C Implementations

### 1. FizzBuzz in C
**Correctness**: Implements FizzBuzz logic correctly.

**Code Quality**: Clean implementation following C conventions.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable for this problem.

### 2. Palindrome Checker in C
**Correctness**: Correctly identifies palindromes, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.

**Code Quality**: Well-structured with clear steps and good comments.

**Error Handling**: Checks for NULL pointers and handles empty strings.

**Concern**: The clean buffer is allocated on the stack with size based on input string length. For very large strings, this could cause stack overflow. A more robust approach would use dynamic memory allocation.

### 3. Binary Search in C
**Correctness**: Correctly implements binary search.

**Code Quality**: Clean implementation with good variable names.

**Error Handling**: Checks for NULL pointers and arrays with non-positive size.

**Improvement**: As with other implementations, doesn't verify that the input array is sorted.

## TypeScript

**1. FizzBuzz:** Correct, good quality, handles the core requirements well.

**2. Palindrome Checker:** Correct and good quality. Handles null and undefined inputs explicitly, which is good practice.

**3. Binary Search:** Correct and good quality.  Handles empty or null arrays correctly. Uses generics appropriately.

Grade: A

## Python

**1. FizzBuzz:** Correct, good quality, idiomatic Python. The use of  `if __name__ == "__main__":` is good practice.

**2. Palindrome Checker:** Correct and good quality. Uses regular expressions effectively for cleaning the string. Handles None input, which is a good practice. Docstrings are well-formatted.

**3. Binary Search:** Correct, good quality code, clear and concise.  Handles None and empty lists correctly.  Docstrings are well-formatted.

Grade: A

## Rust

**1. FizzBuzz:** Correct, good quality, idiomatic Rust.

**2. Palindrome Checker:** Correct and good quality.  Handles empty strings. The character-by-character comparison is efficient.  Good use of iterators and documentation comments.

**3. Binary Search:** Correct and good quality. Handles empty slices correctly.  The use of `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` prevents potential integer overflow. The explicit underflow prevention for `mid == 0` is perhaps overly cautious given that `usize` can't be negative, and `mid - 1` will wrap back to the maximum value in that case, preventing a crash but potentially impacting performance.  Overall though, the function is well-written.  Good use of documentation comments.

Grade: A

## C

**1. FizzBuzz:** Correct, good quality, standard C implementation.

**2. Palindrome Checker:** Correct and good quality. Handles null input. The approach of creating a cleaned string (while using a VLA which might be a minor concern in a real-world scenario) is valid.  The code would benefit from dynamic memory allocation if VLAs are a concern.  Error handling could be improved by returning some indication of the cause of a false return (e.g., null input or not a palindrome), but this is not strictly necessary for the problem as stated.

**3. Binary Search:** Correct, good quality. Handles null pointers and provides a mechanism for checking an empty array via size (although an empty array with size > 0 is technically an incorrect usage). Clear and effectively avoids integer overflow with `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.

Here's the detailed evaluation of the code for each language:

### **TypeScript**
1. **Correctness**: All implementations work as expected. FizzBuzz logic is correct, palindrome handling meets requirements, and binary search works.
2. **Code Quality**: Clean and idiomatic. Generic type in binary search is a good touch. Minor issue: `mid` calculation in binary search should use `left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2)` to avoid theoretical overflow.
3. **Error Handling**: Unnecessary `null`/`undefined` check for strings in `isPalindrome` (TypeScript disallows `null` strings unless `strictNullChecks` is disabled).
4. **Completeness**: All three implemented.

### **Python**
1. **Correctness**: Correct across all problems. The palindrome checker properly handles edge cases and non-strings (e.g., numeric inputs would error in `re.sub`, but function expects a valid string).
2. **Code Quality**: Idiomatic and concise. Prefer `== ""` over `is not` for string emptiness checks. Missing type check for `s` in `is_palindrome` (fails on non-strings).
3. **Error Handling**: Checks `None` but doesn't handle non-string inputs (raises `TypeError`).
4. **Completeness**: All three implemented.

### **Rust**
1. **Correctness**: All implementations work. The binary search prevents underflow with `mid == 0` check. 
2. **Code Quality**: Idiomatic and memory-efficient. Potential Unicode edge case in `to_lowercase()` (e.g., multi-character lowercase conversions), but acceptable for most use cases.
3. **Error Handling**: Binary search handles empty arrays. Palindrome checks edge cases correctly.
4. **Completeness**: All three implemented.

### **C**
1. **Correctness**: Works as expected. Palindrome uses VLA for cleaned strings, which risks stack overflow for large inputs (improvement: use `malloc`).
2. **Code Quality**: Functional but uses VLAs and lacks bounds checking in `clean` buffer (safe for given problem size). Error checks for `NULL` are correct.
3. **Error Handling**: Properly handles `NULL` inputs and empty arrays. VLA in palindrome is a code quality risk.
4. **Completeness**: All three implemented.

### **Summary**
- **Strengths**: Solutions are functionally correct, follow most best practices, and handle edge cases.
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - TypeScript: Safer `mid` calculation in binary search.
  - Python: Add type checking in `is_palindrome`.
  - C: Replace VLAs with dynamic allocation for robustness.

### Overall Assessment

#### TypeScript
Grade: A

#### Python
Grade: A

#### Rust
Grade: A

#### C
Grade: B+

**Justification:**
Each implementation demonstrates good correctness, code quality, and completeness for their respective problem sets. However, while they do not explicitly handle errors in most cases (except for edge cases like null or empty arrays), this is not necessarily a failing point given the simplicity of these problems.

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Error Handling in Simple Cases:** While explicit error handling might not be necessary for these simple problems, it would be a good practice to include basic checks to ensure the input is valid (e.g., checking for negativity or incorrect types) in all implementations.

2. **Comments:** Adding more comments in the C implementation would make it easier to understand for others.

3. **Descriptive Variable Names:** Using more descriptive variable names in all implementations would improve readability and maintainability.

In summary, all implementations except the C one could benefit from occasional additional comments or variable checks but still demonstrate solid performance based on given criteria.

Below is a detailed assessment of the provided solutions in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C for the FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search problems.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1) TypeScript
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Correctness:  
  – FizzBuzz prints the correct output for numbers 1 through 100 and follows the standard FizzBuzz rules.  
  – Palindrome Checker correctly handles null/undefined inputs (returns false), removes non-alphanumeric characters, then checks for palindromes correctly. The edge case of an empty cleaned string returning true is valid per the implementation.  
  – Binary Search operates correctly on sorted arrays, returning the correct index or -1 if not found. One minor consideration is that the function signature "function binarySearch<T>(…)" doesn’t enforce that T can be compared with < or >. In practice, this is usually restricted to numbers or strings, so adding a constraint such as <T extends number | string> would be safer.

• Code Quality:  
  – The code is generally clean, readable, and follows typical TypeScript conventions (e.g., camelCase, type annotations, etc.).  
  – Using specific constraints for the generic binary search would improve type safety.

• Completeness:  
  – All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) are present in TypeScript and appear fully implemented.

• Error Handling:  
  – Palindrome Checker explicitly handles null and undefined.  
  – Binary Search returns -1 for null/empty arrays.  
  – FizzBuzz doesn’t require additional error handling.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2) Python
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Correctness:  
  – FizzBuzz outputs the expected results for the standard rules.  
  – Palindrome Checker leverages a regular expression to remove non-alphanumeric characters, lowercases the result, and checks equality with its reverse. Null (None) inputs return False, which is consistent with the TypeScript approach.  
  – Binary Search correctly returns the target index or -1 if not found.

• Code Quality:  
  – Code style is Pythonic (snake_case function names, docstrings, clear variable names).  
  – The solutions are concise and use common Python idioms.

• Completeness:  
  – All three problems have been implemented and tested.

• Error Handling:  
  – Palindrome Checker and Binary Search both handle None or empty inputs gracefully.  
  – FizzBuzz is straightforward and does not need extra error handling beyond integer iteration.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3) Rust
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Correctness:  
  – FizzBuzz is straightforward, printing up to 100 with correct outputs.  
  – Palindrome Checker filters non-alphanumeric characters and uses a character-by-character comparison. For standard ASCII inputs, this works well, though for some unicode characters with multi-codepoint lowercase expansions, the to_lowercase().next() call could be a subtle edge case. For common inputs, however, it’s correct.  
  – Binary Search properly handles an empty slice and includes a guard when mid == 0 to avoid underflow.

• Code Quality:  
  – Functions are well-structured with clear documentation.  
  – The code follows standard Rust patterns, using iterators and checks as needed.

• Completeness:  
  – All three implementations are present and tested within main().

• Error Handling:  
  – The code safely handles empty inputs for both Palindrome Checker (returns true if everything is filtered out) and Binary Search (returns -1 for empty slices).  
  – FizzBuzz does not specifically need error handling.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4) C
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Correctness:  
  – FizzBuzz prints the correct values and strings for 1 to 100.  
  – Palindrome Checker handles NULL strings, creates a cleaned buffer, and compares characters from both ends. The behavior is correct and matches other implementations.  
  – Binary Search iterates correctly and returns -1 if not found.

• Code Quality:  
  – Code follows common C conventions (e.g., #include statements, proper use of printf, function prototypes).  
  – The palindrome checking logic is carefully implemented with isalnum and tolower for cleaning.

• Completeness:  
  – All three functions (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) exist and are tested via main().

• Error Handling:  
  – Each function checks invalid inputs where appropriate (e.g., NULL checks in Palindrome Checker and Binary Search).  
  – FizzBuzz is straightforward—no special error paths needed.

Summary and Areas for Improvement
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. In TypeScript’s binary search, adding a more specific type constraint would ensure compile-time checks for legitimate comparison operations.  
2. In Rust’s palindrome function, consider the possibility of multi-character lowercase expansions for certain unicode characters (though for most ASCII-based inputs, the current approach is sufficient).  
3. Overall, each language solution is correct, readable, and reasonably idiomatic. There are no major bugs or logic flaws.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each language’s submissions by our four criteria:

─────────────────────────────  
TypeScript Implementations

1. FizzBuzz  
 • Correctness: The loop and conditions are implemented correctly and will output the proper “Fizz”, “Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz” strings.  
 • Code Quality: The code is clean, well-commented, and follows TypeScript/JavaScript conventions.  
 • Completeness: It covers the required range (1–100) and implements the logic fully.  
 • Error Handling: Since the function has no external inputs (other than the hardcoded loop), there’s no error scenario to handle.

2. Palindrome Checker  
 • Correctness: The cleaning of the string—removing non‐alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase—followed by comparing it to its reverse works as expected.  
 • Code Quality: The code is nicely documented and easy to follow. It even handles empty strings gracefully.  
 • Completeness: The implementation covers main edge cases (null/undefined values, empty strings).  
 • Error Handling: The function returns false if given null/undefined and handles empty inputs appropriately.

3. Binary Search  
 • Correctness: The iterative search over the sorted array is implemented correctly. (Note: Although the function is generic, the use of “<” assumes an orderable type; the test cases use numbers, so it works.)  
 • Code Quality: The function is well structured, with a sanity check for an empty array.  
 • Completeness: It covers the three edge cases (found, not found, first element).  
 • Error Handling: It checks for null or empty arrays and returns –1 appropriately.

─────────────────────────────  
Python Implementations

1. FizzBuzz  
 • Correctness: The logic to print “Fizz”, “Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz” for numbers from 1 to 100 is standard and correct.  
 • Code Quality: The function is clear and includes a proper __main__ check.  
 • Completeness: It meets the problem requirements fully.  
 • Error Handling: There are no inputs that can cause errors.

2. Palindrome Checker  
 • Correctness: The use of regular expressions to strip unwanted characters and a subsequent check against its reversal works properly.  
 • Code Quality: Good documentation and clear control flow; it correctly handles None and empty strings.  
 • Completeness: All expected edge cases are considered.  
 • Error Handling: The case where s is None is checked, and an empty cleaned string returns True.

3. Binary Search  
 • Correctness: The iterative binary search correctly returns the index or –1 when not found.  
 • Code Quality: The code is straightforward and includes input validation for a None or empty array.  
 • Completeness: It tests a few representative cases.  
 • Error Handling: It properly returns –1 for invalid input (None or empty list).

─────────────────────────────  
Rust Implementations

1. FizzBuzz  
 • Correctness: Using a for‑loop with the closed range operator yields the correct output.  
 • Code Quality: The code is idiomatic Rust and well organized into functions.  
 • Completeness: The implementation meets the requirements exactly.  
 • Error Handling: There’s no need for special error handling in this simple routine.

2. Palindrome Checker  
 • Correctness: The filter/map chain correctly transforms the input string into a cleaned, lowercase vector of alphanumeric characters and then checks for palindrome properties.  
 • Code Quality: The function is well commented and follows Rust practices. One small note is that the use of to_lowercase().next() works for ASCII but might not cover every Unicode case perfectly (which is acceptable for many applications).  
 • Completeness: All common edge cases (including an empty filtered string) are handled.  
 • Error Handling: There is an implicit check (the cleaned vector’s emptiness) and no crash risk since all operations are done safely.

3. Binary Search  
 • Correctness: The iterative search is correctly implemented and it safely handles unsigned underflow by checking when mid equals 0 before subtracting.  
 • Code Quality: The function is generic over types that implement Ord and is clearly commented.  
 • Completeness: It covers correct behavior on positive cases and when the target isn’t found.  
 • Error Handling: The function returns –1 when given an empty array and prevents underflow.

─────────────────────────────  
C Implementations

1. FizzBuzz  
 • Correctness: Standard implementation using a for‑loop with clear if/else logic ensures correct output.  
 • Code Quality: The code is concise and follows C conventions, with clear print statements.  
 • Completeness: It prints numbers 1–100 with the appropriate modifications.  
 • Error Handling: There is little potential for error in this kind of output routine.

2. Palindrome Checker  
 • Correctness: The function correctly cleans the input string (using isalnum and tolower) and then compares characters from both ends.  
 • Code Quality: The use of a temporary buffer on the stack (with length derived from strlen) is acceptable for sample code. The comments help explain what is happening.  
 • Completeness: It handles cases such as NULL input and empty strings.  
 • Error Handling: It checks for NULL input and also handles an empty string correctly.

3. Binary Search  
 • Correctness: The binary search is implemented using a safe midpoint calculation (avoiding potential overflow) and correctly adjusts the boundaries.  
 • Code Quality: The code is clear and succinct.  
 • Completeness: It works on a statically defined sorted array and returns the correct index or –1.  
 • Error Handling: It checks for a NULL array pointer and sizes less than or equal to zero before proceeding.

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Completeness and Final Remarks

• Completeness: All three classic problems are implemented in all four languages.
• Correctness: Every implementation is correct for the given test cases.
• Code Quality: The code in every language is well organized, idiomatic, and easy to read.
• Error Handling: Each language handles potential error cases appropriately given the context of the problem.

The solutions are well-thought-out and nearly textbook perfect aside from a few minor considerations (like the generality in TypeScript’s binary search or slight Unicode nuances in Rust’s palindrome checker). In a technical interview setting, these would be viewed as excellent.
