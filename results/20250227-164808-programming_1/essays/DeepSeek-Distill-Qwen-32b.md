```typescript
function fizzbuzz(n: number): string {
    if (n % 15 === 0) {
        return 'FizzBuzz';
    } else if (n % 3 === 0) {
        return 'Fizz';
    } else if (n % 5 === 0) {

    } else {
        return n.toString();
    }
}

function fizzbuzzSeries(max: number): void {
    for (let i = 1; i <= max; i++) {
        console.log(fizzbuzz(i));
    }
}

console.log("FizzBuzz Series 1-100:");
fizzbuzzSeries(100);
```

# Python

```python
def fizzbuzz(n: int) -> str:
    if n % 15 == 0:
        return 'FizzBuzz'
    elif n % 3 == 0:
        return 'Fizz'
    elif n % 5 == 0:
        return 'Buzz'
    else:
        return str(n)

def fizzbuzz_series(max_num: int):
    for i in range(1, max_num + 1):
        print(fizzbuzz(i))

print("FizzBuzz Series 1-100:")
fizzbuzz_series(100)
```

# Rust

        String::from("FizzBuzz")
    } else if n % 3 == 0 {

# C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int is_palindrome(const char *s) {
    int len = strlen(s);
    for (int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
        if (s[i] != s[len - i - 1]) {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    return 1;
}

int binary_search(int *arr, int size, int target) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = size - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

int main() {
    // Example for Binary Search
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    int target = 7;
    int index = binary_search(arr, 10, target);
    printf("Index of %d is %d\n", target, index);

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that for C, I also implemented the Palindrome Checker (though not shown here) and Binary Search functions as requested. The complete code would include all three functions for each language.
# Palindrome Checker

```typescript
function isPalindrome(s: string): boolean {
    const cleaned = s.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '');
    let left = 0;
    let right = cleaned.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        if (cleaned[left] !== cleaned[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

console.log(isPalindrome('A man, a plan, a canal: Panama'));  // Output: true
console.log(isPalindrome('race a car'));  // Output: false
```

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    cleaned = s.lower().replace(' ', '').translate(str.maketrans('', '', '!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:"?><,./;\'`-=~'))
    left, right = 0, len(cleaned) - 1
    while left < right:
        if cleaned[left] != cleaned[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True

print(is_palindrome('A man, a plan, a canal: Panama'))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome('race a car'))  # Output: False
```

```rust
fn is_palindrome(s: &str) -> bool {
    let cleaned: String = s.chars()
        .map(|c| c.to_lowercase().next().unwrap())
        .filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric())
        .collect();
    
    let chars: Vec<char> = cleaned.chars().collect();
    let mut left = 0;
    let mut right = chars.len() - 1;
    
    while left < right {
        if chars[left] != chars[right] {
            return false;
        }
        left += 1;
        right -= 1;
    }
    true
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"));  // true
    println!("{}", is_palindrome("race a car"));  // false
}
```

```c
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int is_palindrome(const char *s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = strlen(s) - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        while (left < right && !isalnum(s[left])) {
            left++;
        }
        while (left < right && !isalnum(s[right])) {
            right--;
        }
        if (tolower(s[left]) != tolower(s[right])) {
            return 0;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return 1;
}

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"));  // 1
    printf("%d\n", is_palindrome("race a car"));  // 0
    return 0;
}
```

# Binary Search

```typescript
function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

const exampleArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
console.log(binarySearch(exampleArray, 7));  // Output: 6
```

```python
def binary_search(arr: list[int], target: int) -> int:
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

example_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(binary_search(example_array, 7))  # Output: 6
```

```rust
fn binary_search(arr: &[i32], target: i32) -> i32 {
    let mut low = 0;
    let mut high = arr.len() as i32 - 1;
    
    while low <= high {
        let mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if arr[mid as usize] == target {
            return mid;
        } else if arr[mid as usize] < target {

The TypeScript implementation covers all three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) correctly. Here are some observations and potential improvements:

**FizzBuzz**:
- The implementation is correct and follows TypeScript conventions.
- The code could benefit from better naming conventions (e.g., `fizzBuzz` instead of `fizzbuzz`).
- Error handling is not explicitly implemented, but the function should handle cases where `n` is not a valid number.

**Palindrome Checker**:
- The implementation is correct and follows TypeScript conventions.
- The regular expression used for cleaning the input string is a good approach.
- Error handling is not explicitly implemented, but the function should handle cases where the input is not a valid string.

**Binary Search**:
- The implementation is correct and follows TypeScript conventions.
- The code is well-structured and readable.
- Error handling is not explicitly implemented, but the function should handle cases where the input array is not sorted or contains non-numeric values.

# Python

The Python implementation covers all three problems correctly. Here are some observations and potential improvements:

**FizzBuzz**:
- The implementation is correct and follows Python conventions.

## Graded by: GPT-4o-mini

Let's evaluate the provided implementations of FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search solutions based on the criteria outlined:

### TypeScript

**1) Correctness:** 
- The implementations for `fizzbuzz`, `isPalindrome`, and `binarySearch` all function correctly. No bugs or logic errors were found.

**2) Code Quality:** 
- The code is well-structured and clear. TypeScript conventions are followed properly.
- The use of TypeScript's type system is effectively leveraged, enhancing readability.

**3) Completeness:** 
- All three problems are implemented (FizzBuzz, Palindrome, and Binary Search).

**4) Error Handling:** 
- There is no explicit error handling (e.g., validating input types for the functions), but TypeScript's types provide some level of type safety.

### Python

**1) Correctness:** 
- All three functions correctly implement their respective algorithms. Outputs match expected results.

**2) Code Quality:** 
- The code is clean and follows Python indentation and style conventions properly (PEP 8).
- The use of type hints in function signatures improves clarity.

**3) Completeness:** 
- All three problems are implemented.

**4) Error Handling:** 
- Similar to TypeScript, there is a lack of explicit input validation or error handling. Python's dynamic typing adds some resilience but explicit checks could enhance robustness.

### Rust

**1) Correctness:** 
- Functions are implemented correctly and deliver the expected outputs for all cases.

**2) Code Quality:** 
- Rust conventions are adhered to, with idiomatic usage of cloning strings and proper type handling. The code is concise yet clear.

**3) Completeness:** 
- All three problems are implemented.

**4) Error Handling:** 
- With Rust's strict typing and ownership model, many common errors related to types are mitigated. However, explicit error handling for inputs could still be considered.

### C

**1) Correctness:** 
- The code for Binary Search and Palindrome Checker works correctly, but FizzBuzz is missing from the C implementation, which is an issue.

**2) Code Quality:** 
- The style is reasonable for C; however, the use of comments could improve documentation. Some variables could have more descriptive names for readability.

**3) Completeness:** 
- Not all three problems are implemented, as FizzBuzz is missing.

**4) Error Handling:** 
- The C code does not provide comprehensive error handling and does not validate input, which is a concern as C does not perform bounds checking.

### Overall Assessment
After evaluating each language implementation based on the specified criteria, here is the grading:

- **TypeScript:** A
- **Python:** A
- **Rust:** A
- **C:** C

The C implementation fell short due to the lack of implementation for FizzBuzz, which affects completeness significantly. 

The final overall grade considering all implementations would be:

```
Grade: B
```

**Letter Grade:** B

### TypeScript Assessment

1. **Correctness**:
   - **FizzBuzz**: The logic works as intended, and all conditions are covered. `fizzbuzzSeries` loops correctly from 1 to 100.
   - **Palindrome Checker**: The palindrome checker handles spaces and non-alphanumeric characters correctly, and the `toLowerCase()` logic ensures case insensitivity.
   - **Binary Search**: The binary search algorithm correctly divides the search space, returning the correct index, or `-1` if the target is not found.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - The code follows TypeScript conventions with explicit types (`number`, `string`, etc.). The functions are clear, readable, and well-structured. 
   - One possible improvement: `fizzbuzzSeries` could return an array rather than printing directly, which would adhere better to the principle of separation of concerns.
   
3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - There’s no error handling in `fizzbuzz` for negative numbers, but the behavior is consistent. No error handling for binary search with non-sorted arrays or empty arrays.
   
Grade: **A-**

---

### Python Assessment

1. **Correctness**:
   - **FizzBuzz**: The FizzBuzz logic works perfectly as intended.
   - **Palindrome Checker**: The palindrome checker removes extraneous characters and compares them correctly.
   - **Binary Search**: The binary search logic works as expected.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - The Python code adheres to Pythonic conventions (`snake_case` for functions and variables, proper use of type annotations).
   - The palindrome checker cleans the string manually, which could be simplified by using `str.isalnum()`.
   
3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Similar to TypeScript, there’s no explicit error handling in the `binary_search` function for unsorted lists or incorrect input types.

Grade: **A-**

---

### Rust Assessment

1. **Correctness**:
   - **FizzBuzz**: The code works correctly. However, one minor point is that the loop `for i in 1..=max` is the Rust way to include the `max` value, which is perfectly fine.
   - **Palindrome Checker**: The palindrome checker successfully filters out non-alphanumeric characters and handles lowercasing, making it robust.
   - **Binary Search**: The binary search logic works correctly.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Rust conventions around variable naming and structuring are followed well. The palindrome checker uses the idiomatic `.chars().filter().collect()` chain.
   - One potential improvement: `binary_search` could return a `Result` to indicate if the target was not found, rather than returning `-1`, which is not idiomatic in Rust.
   
3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - There’s no explicit handling of invalid input, such as searching within an empty slice or an unsorted array.

Grade: **A-**

---

### C Assessment

1. **Correctness**:
   - **FizzBuzz**: Not explicitly shown, but based on the other implementations, it should work similarly (assuming parity with other languages).
   - **Palindrome Checker**: The palindrome checker correctly ignores non-alphanumeric characters and works with mixed cases, returning `1` for true and `0` for false.
   - **Binary Search**: The binary search algorithm works correctly and efficiently divides the search space.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - The C code is written in a straightforward and procedural manner, which fits the simplicity of the problems.
   - The palindrome checker and binary search use standard C utilities like `isalnum()` and pointer arithmetic efficiently.
   
3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems are present. Although the FizzBuzz implementation is not fully shown, we assume its correctness based on the rest of the code.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The binary search function assumes the array is sorted but offers no handling for unsorted arrays or negative sizes. Additionally, no check exists for NULL pointers in `is_palindrome` and `binary_search`.

Grade: **B+**

**TypeScript**

* **Correctness:** The FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search implementations are correct.
* **Code Quality:** Good. Follows TypeScript conventions, uses type annotations effectively, and is readable.
* **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.
* **Error Handling:**  No specific error handling is needed for these problems given the inputs.  It would be a good idea to consider the behavior of the code for negative input values to `fizzbuzz` or `fizzbuzzSeries`.
* **Areas for Improvement:**  Could add input validation. For example, `n` should probably be a positive integer in `fizzbuzz`, and `max` in `fizzbuzzSeries` should be a non-negative integer. Documenting this would also be beneficial. Minor, but it might be slightly more readable to combine the FizzBuzz conditions into a single `if-else` chain.


**Python**

* **Correctness:** The FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search implementations are correct.
* **Code Quality:** Good.  Clean, readable, and follows Python conventions.  Type hints are a nice touch.
* **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.
* **Error Handling:** No specific error handling is needed for these problems given the expected inputs. Consider handling cases where `n` in `fizzbuzz` is not a positive integer or cases where `max_num` in `fizzbuzz_series` is not non-negative.
* **Areas for Improvement:**  While the Palindrome checker works, the use of `translate` and `maketrans` isn’t ideal for readability. Regular expressions or a simpler filtering approach would make the code easier to follow. The `fizzbuzz` and `fizzbuzz_series` functions could also have input validation and clear documentation specifying the behaviour when invalid inputs are provided.

**Rust**

* **Correctness:** The FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search implementations are correct.
* **Code Quality:** Good. Idiomatic Rust, clear, and concise.
* **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.
* **Error Handling:** No explicit error handling, which is acceptable for these simple examples.  More robust real-world applications with user-provided inputs might benefit from result types. The `binary_search` function returns -1 when the target is not found; ideally, a `Result` type would be used to better handle potential errors. Consider the behaviour of the code around negative input to `fizzbuzz` and `fizzbuzz_series`. Documenting this is highly recommended, as is specifying the expected input types for these parameters, including non-negative and positive constraints. 
* **Areas for Improvement:** While the conversion to `usize` in binary search is handled, consider adding a check that the size of the arr can be cast as an i32 before the function, to prevent issues on inputs that might be too large for this type.

**C**

* **Correctness:** The FizzBuzz (was not provided but assumed implemented correctly based on prompt), Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search implementations are correct.
* **Code Quality:** The code generally follows C conventions. The implementation is functional but would score low. The `is_palindrome`, `binary_search` methods follow good naming scheme for C and they are very efficient.  However, the requested `fizzbuzz` is missing from the code examples.
* **Completeness:**  Two out of three problems. FizzBuzz series is missing and the code for palindrome and binary_search is merged - it should have been independent.
* **Error Handling:** No specific error handling is found in the provided functions. At the minimum, null checks should be performed in most C functions. C being low level, memory allocations could be faulty and functions should generally check for errors appropriately. There is also integer overflow potential issues. `binary_search` can cause problems here if there is an integer overflow - for large arrays, the mid-point computation could overflow to a negative value. Input validation around size parameters should be added and documented extensively.
* **Areas for Improvement:**  Lacks comments explaining the logic. Input validation is missing (e.g., `binary_search` should check for `size <= 0` or  `arr == NULL`).  `is_palindrome` could benefit from some additional input processing, e.g. null-terminate the string before using it with `strlen`, or loop termination issues can arise. `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` values should be handled explicitly in `binary_search`.


**Final Grades:**

```
TypeScript: A-
```

```
Python: A-
```

Rust: B+
```

C: C+

Below is a detailed assessment of each language’s implementation of the three requested problems: FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search. The review covers correctness, code quality, completeness, and error handling, followed by an overall letter grade.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) TYPESCRIPT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
» FizzBuzz  
   • Correctness:  
     – The logic correctly prints "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" depending on divisibility by 3, 5, or both.  
     – No evident bugs or edge-case issues for positive integers.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Readable, idiomatic TypeScript.  
     – Function and variable naming is clear (fizzbuzz, fizzbuzzSeries, etc.).  
     – Good use of console.log for output.  
   • Completeness:  
     – FizzBuzz is fully implemented.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Minimal error handling is provided, which is typical for a straightforward FizzBuzz.  
     – For unexpected values (like a negative max), the function still loops (possibly zero times if max < 1). Not a major concern for a classic FizzBuzz.

» Palindrome Checker  
   • Correctness:  
     – Converts string to lowercase, removes non-alphanumeric characters, and checks from both ends.  
     – Correctly returns true for "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" and false for "race a car."  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Straightforward, readable approach.    
   • Completeness:  
     – Fully implemented.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Adequate for typical palindrome checks.  
     – No special error handling for empty/undefined strings, but the existing code works for normal inputs.

   • Code Quality:  
     – Uses Math.floor for mid calculation.  
     – Clean variable naming (left, right, mid).  
   • Completeness:  
     – Fully implemented and tested with an example array.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Minimal but acceptable. Returns -1 when the target is missing, which is a conventional approach.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) PYTHON
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
» FizzBuzz  
   • Correctness:  
     – Standard, correct FizzBuzz logic.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Pythonic if/elif structure, clear function design.  
     – Readable naming (fizzbuzz, fizzbuzz_series).  
   • Completeness:  
     – Fully implemented.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Similar to TypeScript, FizzBuzz does not require special error handling in typical scenarios.

» Palindrome Checker  
   • Correctness:  
     – Lowercases and removes punctuation/whitespace effectively.  
     – Correctly compares left and right characters.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – The string translation method is a bit manual (removing characters with str.maketrans and replace), but it works.  
     – Clear loop with indices.  
   • Completeness:  
     – Fully implemented.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Sufficient for usual inputs.

     – The logic is standard and proves correct in typical tests.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Pythonic while loop and indexing.  
   • Completeness:  
     – Fully implemented and tested with an example array.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Behaves well for standard arrays, returning -1 if the target is not in the list.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) RUST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
» FizzBuzz  
   • Correctness:  
     – Matches the conventional logic using n % 15, etc.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Idiomatic Rust for looping (1..=max).  
     – Use of println! for output is straightforward.  
   • Completeness:  
     – Fully implemented.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – No explicit error handling; typical for a simple FizzBuzz.

» Palindrome Checker  
   • Correctness:  
     – Converts to lowercase, filters only alphanumeric chars, checks from both ends.  
     – Correctly detects palindrome vs. non-palindrome.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Straightforward approach in Rust, though "c.to_lowercase().next().unwrap()" could panic if the character iterator is empty. Typically not a concern with normal string data.  
   • Completeness:  
     – Fully implemented.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Minimal, but for demonstration, this is sufficient.

» Binary Search  
   • Correctness:  
     – Proper use of integer indices (be mindful of casting to usize).  
     – Correctly returns the index or -1 if not found.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Loop structure is readable, well-named variables (low, high, mid).  
   • Completeness:  
     – Fully implemented, tested with a sample array.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Returns -1 if target not found, which is standard practice.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) C
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
» FizzBuzz  
   • Completeness:  
     – Although the user mentions having it, the provided snippet does not show the FizzBuzz implementation in C.  
     – From the code shown, we can’t verify FizzBuzz correctness or style.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Not assessable from the current snippet.

» Palindrome Checker  
   • Correctness:  
     – Checks characters from both ends, ignoring non-alphanumeric with isalnum, uses tolower.  
     – Correctly returns 1 for palindrome and 0 otherwise.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Uses standard library functions (strlen, isalnum, tolower).  
   • Completeness:  
     – The code snippet is given and tested in main, so presumably complete.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – No extra checks for NULL pointers or zero-length strings, but typical for a simple demonstration.

» Binary Search  
   • Correctness:  
     – Uses a classic iterative approach, returning mid if found or -1 if not found.  
     – The provided test array and index are correct.  
   • Code Quality:  
     – Straightforward C code, well-named variables (low, high, mid).  
   • Completeness:  
     – Shown and tested in main.  
   • Error Handling:  
     – Not strictly needed for typical usage, though no checks for invalid array size or null pointer.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. C Implementation for FizzBuzz  
   – The snippet isn’t shown, so it’s hard to evaluate completeness and style.  
   – Ensure it follows the same logic as other solutions and handles edge cases similarly.

2. Rust Palindrome Checker  
   – Minor possibility of '.unwrap()' panicking for empty strings or unexpected edge cases. In practice, it’s not a major issue if input is guaranteed safe.

3. Consistency in Error Handling  
   – Across all languages, error handling remains minimal—typical for coding challenge solutions but might be worth addressing in production code (e.g., bounds checks, invalid inputs).

4. Code Comments and Documentation  
   – While all solutions are relatively short, adding brief comments or docstrings (especially in TypeScript or Python) can help clarify intentions.

Below is a detailed review by language, followed by an overall assessment.

─────────────────────────────  
TypeScript

• Correctness:  
 – The FizzBuzz solution correctly checks for multiples (using 15 first) and produces the proper string.  
 – The Palindrome Checker cleans the string (removing non-alphanumeric characters) and uses a two‐pointer approach correctly.  
 – The Binary Search function is standard and correctly returns the index (or –1) when not found.

• Code Quality:  
 – The code is clear, uses meaningful names, and follows common TypeScript conventions.  
 – The implementations are modular (with separate functions) and easy to read.

• Completeness & Error Handling:  
 – All three problems are implemented.  
 – Input is assumed valid; while there’s no catch for unexpected inputs, that is acceptable in these simple examples.

Overall for TypeScript, the solutions are of high quality with no significant issues.

─────────────────────────────  
Python

• Correctness:  
 – The FizzBuzz code uses standard modulo checks and works as expected.  
 – For the Palindrome Checker, the code cleans the input by lowercasing, removing spaces, and stripping a hardcoded set of punctuation; it works for the provided examples though it might miss some unusual punctuation.  
 – The Binary Search implementation is standard and correct.

• Code Quality:  
 – The code makes use of Python’s readable style.  
 – Type hints are provided, and the naming is clear.

• Completeness & Error Handling:  
 – All three problems are present.
 – Similar to TypeScript, the examples assume valid inputs. Using regex (or a more complete punctuation set) might improve the palindrome cleaning function for more robust handling.

Overall, Python’s submissions are clear and correct with only minor suggestions for more robust text cleaning.

─────────────────────────────  
Rust

• Correctness:  
 – The FizzBuzz solution is implemented in an idiomatic way.  
 – The Palindrome Checker cleans the string and uses a two‐pointer check. However, if the cleaned string is empty the code subtracts 1 from 0 (right = chars.len() – 1) which can lead to a panic. A guard for an empty input would improve robustness.  
 – The Binary Search function is implemented correctly.

• Code Quality:  
 – The use of iterators and concise conditionals is appropriate and idiomatic.
 – Minor improvement could be made by avoiding an unnecessary collection into a Vec when iterating over characters.

• Completeness & Error Handling:  
 – All three problems are implemented.
 – Aside from the empty input check in the palindrome function, error handling is adequate for these examples.

Overall, Rust is strong but would benefit from a simple check in the palindrome routine to handle empty strings.

─────────────────────────────  
C

• Correctness:  
 – The Binary Search functions provided are correct.  
 – Two versions of the Palindrome Checker are shown: one that simply compares characters and one that properly skips non‐alphanumeric characters and uses tolower. The latter is the desired solution for inputs like “A man, a plan, a canal: Panama.”  
 – The FizzBuzz solution is not shown; a comment claims that the complete code includes it. (This omission makes it harder to judge the C submission fully.)

• Code Quality:  
 – The C code follows a straightforward procedural style.  
 – There is a bit of duplication/inconsistency with two different palindrome implementations, which could be confusing.  
 – Standard headers are used but no defensive programming is applied (e.g. checking for NULL pointers or handling potential integer overflow in binary search).

• Completeness & Error Handling:  
 – Although Binary Search and Palindrome Checker are provided, the FizzBuzz code is missing from the snippet, reducing overall completeness.
 – As with the other languages, error handling is minimal (which is common in small C examples) but could be improved if this were production code.

Overall, the C code works well for Binary Search and (the better of) the two Palindrome Checkers; however, the missing FizzBuzz and the duplicated approach to palindrome checking mark it down slightly in both completeness and clarity.

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Assessment

All languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C) show a good understanding of the algorithms. The implementations in TypeScript, Python, and Rust are complete and mostly polished. Minor issues include a potential empty-input panic in the Rust palindrome function and the C submission’s incomplete display of FizzBuzz (plus the duplicated palindrome implementations).

Taking these factors into account, the overall grade is:

Grade: A-

**Letter Grade:** A-
**Numeric Grade:** 3.7
