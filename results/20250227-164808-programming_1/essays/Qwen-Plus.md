Here are the implementations of the three classic programming problems in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C. Each implementation is complete, follows best practices, and is organized with appropriate functions.

---

### TypeScript Implementation

```typescript
// FizzBuzz
function fizzBuzz() {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 15 === 0) {
            console.log("FizzBuzz");
        } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
            console.log("Fizz");
        } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
            console.log("Buzz");
        } else {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
}

// Palindrome Checker
function isPalindrome(s: string): boolean {
    const cleaned = s.replace(/[^a-z0-9]/gi, '').toLowerCase();
    const reversed = cleaned.split('').reverse().join('');
    return cleaned === reversed;
}

// Binary Search
function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

// Example Usage
fizzBuzz();
console.log(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // true
console.log(binarySearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 7)); // 6
```

### Python Implementation

```python
# FizzBuzz
def fizz_buzz():
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if i % 15 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

# Palindrome Checker
import re

def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9]', '', s.lower())
    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]

# Binary Search
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example Usage
fizz_buzz()
print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"))  # True
print(binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 7))  # 6
```

### Rust Implementation

```rust
// FizzBuzz
fn fizz_buzz() {
    for i in 1..=100 {
        match (i % 3, i % 5) {
            (0, 0) => println!("FizzBuzz"),
            (0, _) => println!("Fizz"),
            (_, 0) => println!("Buzz"),
            _ => println!("{}", i),
        }
    }
}

// Palindrome Checker
fn is_palindrome(s: &str) -> bool {
    let cleaned: String = s.chars()
        .filter(|c| c.is_alphanumeric())
        .map(|c| c.to_ascii_lowercase())
        .collect();
    cleaned == cleaned.chars().rev().collect::<String>()
}

// Binary Search
fn binary_search(arr: &[i32], target: i32) -> isize {
    let mut left = 0;
    let mut right = arr.len() as isize - 1;

    while left <= right {
        let mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if arr[mid as usize] == target {
            return mid;
        } else if arr[mid as usize] < target {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    -1
}

// Example Usage
fn main() {
    fizz_buzz();
    println!("{}", is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // true
    println!("{}", binary_search(&[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 7)); // 6
}
```

#include <stdbool.h>

// FizzBuzz
void fizzBuzz() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 15 == 0) {
            printf("FizzBuzz\n");
        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            printf("Fizz\n");
        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            printf("Buzz\n");
        } else {
            printf("%d\n", i);
        }
    }
}

// Helper function to check if a character is alphanumeric
bool isAlphanumeric(char c) {
    return isalnum(c);
}

// Palindrome Checker
bool isPalindrome(const char* s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = strlen(s) - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        while (left < right && !isAlphanumeric(s[left])) left++;
        while (left < right && !isAlphanumeric(s[right])) right--;
        if (tolower(s[left]) != tolower(s[right])) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

// Binary Search
int binarySearch(int arr[], int size, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = size - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

// Example Usage
int main() {
    fizzBuzz();
    printf("%d\n", isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // 1 (true)
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    printf("%d\n", binarySearch(arr, 10, 7)); // 6
    return 0;
}
```

Let's evaluate the implementations of FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search across TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C based on the specified criteria.

### TypeScript Implementation

1. **Correctness**: The FizzBuzz implementation correctly prints "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz". The palindrome checker correctly identifies palindromes after cleaning the input, and the binary search function operates correctly.
  
2. **Code Quality**: The code follows TypeScript conventions, uses meaningful function names, and is well-structured. The formatting is consistent and improves readability.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: The implementations are straightforward and do not account for potential edge cases in input (such as non-numeric data in the binary search function). However, given the context, this may not be necessary.

**Assessment**: The code is correct, well-structured, complete, but could have better error handling.

### Python Implementation

1. **Correctness**: The implementations work as expected; FizzBuzz prints the correct outputs, the palindrome function accurately checks for palindromes, and the binary search yields correct results.

2. **Code Quality**: The code adheres to Python conventions and ideal practices such as using `re` for regex operations and list comprehensions. It is also easy to read and follows the PEP 8 style guide.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented thoroughly.

4. **Error Handling**: As in the TypeScript version, the code's error handling for the binary search is minimal but suitable for a simple use case. The main function could benefit from handling edge cases like an empty list.

**Assessment**: The code is effective and maintains good readability and structure.

### Rust Implementation

1. **Correctness**: The Rust implementations are accurate. FizzBuzz functions correctly, the palindrome checker accounts for alphanumeric characters, and the binary search returns the correct index or -1.

2. **Code Quality**: The implementations follow Rust conventions, including safe memory practices by using slices. The use of iterators and pattern matching in FizzBuzz reflects good Rust idioms.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are present.

4. **Error Handling**: Similar to previous implementations, there is basic error handling. However, in Rust, additional types could enhance safety.

**Assessment**: Overall, the implementations are correct, idiomatic, and well-structured.

### C Implementation

1. **Correctness**: The C code performs as expected for FizzBuzz, the palindrome checker is functional and accounts for non-alphanumeric characters, and the binary search operates correctly.

2. **Code Quality**: While the code works, it has some areas that could be improved for better readability. It's well-structured with functions; however, mixing logic and input reading in `main` could be better organized.

3. **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: The C version does good work handling alphanumeric checks in the palindrome code, but it lacks comprehensive error detection in the binary search (such as checking if the array length is zero).

**Assessment**: The code is functionally correct, though it could benefit from improved organization and error handling.

### Overall Grade

Given the assessments across all implementations, each language is technically correct and complete, following best practices in its respective idioms. However, some implementations, particularly in TypeScript and Python, could enhance error handling. The Rust implementation stands out for its idiomatic use, while C has some room for improved organization.

### Final Grading

Grade: A

**Letter Grade:** A
**Numeric Grade:** 4.0

## Graded by: Qwen-Max

### TypeScript Implementation

1. **Correctness**:
   - **FizzBuzz**: Correct. The logic handles multiples of 3, 5, and 15 correctly. There are no bugs.
   - **Palindrome Checker**: Correct. The `isPalindrome` function appropriately cleans the string, removes non-alphanumeric characters, and checks if the string is the same forwards and backwards.
   - **Binary Search**: Correct. The `binarySearch` function uses the correct midpoint formula and correctly increments/decrements the search bounds.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - TypeScript follows conventions well. Functions are appropriately named and structured. Type annotations are provided (`s: string` and `arr: number[]`).
   - The use of `console.log` directly in functions limits reusability. Separation of concerns (e.g., returning results instead of printing directly) would improve modularity and testability.
   - Variable names like `mid`, `left`, and `right` are clear and follow conventions.

3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - There is no explicit error handling. For example, the `binarySearch` function assumes the input array is sorted (which is a requirement for binary search). If passed an unsorted array, it will not work correctly. Adding a check for sorted input could improve robustness.
   - The `isPalindrome` function does not handle `null` or `undefined` values. It could lead to runtime errors if a `null` string is passed.

**Improvements**:
   - Use `const` instead of `let` wherever variables are not reassigned.
   - Consider making functions pure (i.e., return values instead of printing them) to improve testability.

---

### Python Implementation

1. **Correctness**:
   - **FizzBuzz**: Correct. The logic handles multiples of 3, 5, and 15 as expected.
   - **Palindrome Checker**: Correct. The `is_palindrome` function uses a regular expression to clean input and correctly checks for palindromes.
   - **Binary Search**: Correct. The binary search follows the standard algorithm and correctly handles edge cases.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Pythonic style is followed closely. Slicing (`[::-1]`) is used efficiently for reversing strings in the palindrome checker.
   - Type hints (e.g., `s: str` and `arr: list`) enhance clarity.
   - Similar to TypeScript, `print` is used directly in functions, limiting reusability. Returning results would make the functions more flexible.

3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Like TypeScript, there’s no check for whether the array is sorted in `binary_search`.
   - The `is_palindrome` function assumes the input will always be a string but does not handle potential input errors like `None`.

**Improvements**:
   - Refactor the `fizz_buzz` and `is_palindrome` functions to return values instead of printing.
   - Add a sorted input validation in `binary_search`.

---

### Rust Implementation

1. **Correctness**:
   - **FizzBuzz**: Correct. The `match` statement is idiomatic and handles all combinations of 3 and 5 properly.
   - **Palindrome Checker**: Correct. The function filters non-alphanumeric characters and compares the cleaned string with its reverse.
   - **Binary Search**: Correct. The function handles bounds and midpoint arithmetic properly. The return type is consistently `isize`, allowing `-1` for not found.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Rust idioms are followed, including the use of iterators, closures, and the `match` statement.
   - Code readability is strong due to idiomatic constructs.
   - `isize` return type for `binary_search` is a good choice, as it allows negative return values to indicate "not found."

3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The binary search does not validate if the array is sorted.
   - No explicit handling for empty strings or strings containing only non-alphanumeric characters in `is_palindrome`.

**Improvements**:
   - Add a sorted validation check for binary search.
   - Handle edge cases in `is_palindrome`, such as an empty string or a string with only invalid characters.

---

### C Implementation

1. **Correctness**:
   - **FizzBuzz**: Correct. The logic handles multiples of 3, 5, and 15 without issue.
   - **Palindrome Checker**: Correct. The function successfully strips non-alphanumeric characters and checks for palindrome properties.
   - **Binary Search**: Correct. The midpoint calculation and bounds management are done carefully.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - C implementation follows conventions well. Functions are well-named and readable.
   - The code is a bit more verbose due to the lack of higher-level constructs available in higher-level languages, but it’s still quite readable.
   - Using `printf` inside functions limits reusability. Returning results would make these functions more general-purpose.

3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems are implemented.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The `binarySearch` function does not validate if the input array is sorted.
   - `isPalindrome` does not handle strings that are empty or contain only non-alphanumeric characters.
   - The return type of `isPalindrome` could be improved. Returning `bool` is correct, but consider returning a result type or error code for edge cases.

**Improvements**:
   - Add checks for sorted arrays in `binarySearch`.
   - Consider separating concerns (i.e., move `printf` outside functions) for better modularity.
   - Improve `isPalindrome` to handle edge cases like empty strings.

---

### Overall Assessment and Grading

- **Correctness**: All four implementations solve the problems correctly. However, none of them handle edge cases or potential errors particularly well.
- **Code Quality**: All implementations follow good conventions and are readable, but TypeScript and C could benefit from refactoring `print`/`printf` statements out of functions.
- **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented in all four languages.
- **Error Handling**: None of the implementations consistently check for potential input errors or assumptions (e.g., array sorting). More robust handling would improve the grade significantly.

Okay, I have reviewed all the implementations of FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C based on correctness, code quality, completeness, and error handling. Here's my assessment:

**TypeScript Implementation**

*   **Correctness:** All three functions (fizzBuzz, isPalindrome, binarySearch) work correctly and produce the expected outputs.
*   **Code Quality:** The code adheres to TypeScript conventions.  Types are used appropriately. The isPalindrome function uses regular expressions effectively for cleaning the input string. The binary search uses `Math.floor` appropriately to handle integer division.
*   **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling:** No specific error handling is included, but the examples implicitly handle typical inputs.  Binary search does not validate the input array is sorted (a general best practice).

**Python Implementation**

*   **Correctness:** All three functions (fizz_buzz, is_palindrome, binary_search) work correctly.
*   **Code Quality:** The code is well-structured and follows Python conventions. The `re` module for regular expressions is properly used in the palindrome checker. Integer division `//` is used which prevents potential floating point conversion issues.
*   **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling:**  Similar to TypeScript, no explicit error checking is present, but the implementations handle typical inputs reasonably well. Binary search assumes the array is sorted.

**Rust Implementation**

*   **Correctness:** All three functions (fizz_buzz, is_palindrome, binary_search) appear to work correctly.
*   **Code Quality:** Rust conventions are largely followed successfully. The use of `match` in FizzBuzz is idiomatic and clear. The palindrome checker effectively uses iterators for filtering and reversing the string. Crucially, the code includes `to_ascii_lowercase()` which handles Unicode strings properly.
*   **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented, and are within the `main` function for running.
*   **Error Handling:**  The binary search returns -1 for not found, but could benefit from using the `Result` type to convey failure more explicitly. The length check in binary search is implemented using `isize`, a signed integer type.

**C Implementation**

*   **Correctness:**  Functions `fizzBuzz`, `isPalindrome`, `binarySearch` work as expected.  The palindrome function correctly ignores non-alphanumeric characters.
*   **Code Quality:** The C code follows C conventions.  It's readable and well-structured for C. The helper function `isAlphanumeric` improves readability of `isPalindrome`.
*   **Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.
*   **Error Handling:** Like the other implementations, error handling is minimal.  The binary search implementation implicitly assumes the input array `arr` to `binarySearch` is sorted. `strlen` is called on the string pointed to by `s`, which makes the correct output dependent on the string being null terminated.

**Overall Assessment and Grades**

All languages have correct implementations, but there are subtle differences in best practices across the languages. Considering these nuances, the code is well-written.

**TypeScript Implementation**

* **Correctness:** Correct.
* **Code Quality:** Good.  Clear and concise. Uses type annotations effectively.
* **Completeness:** Complete. All three functions are present.
* **Error Handling:**  No explicit error handling, but the functions are robust enough for the given inputs.  Consider adding input validation for production code (e.g., checking for null/undefined array in `binarySearch`).
* **Areas for improvement:**  For larger projects, consider splitting the functions into separate modules/files.

Grade: A

**Python Implementation**

* **Correctness:** Correct.
* **Code Quality:** Good. Pythonic and readable. Uses type hints.
* **Completeness:** Complete.
* **Error Handling:** Similar to TypeScript, no explicit error handling, but generally robust.  Could benefit from input validation, especially for the `binary_search` function, in a real-world application.
* **Areas for improvement:** None significant.

Grade: A

**Rust Implementation**

* **Correctness:** Correct. Efficient use of `match` in `fizz_buzz`.
* **Code Quality:** Excellent. Idiomatic Rust code.  Clear error handling in the conversion from `isize` to `usize` via bounds checking.
* **Completeness:** Complete.
* **Error Handling:** While not explicit exception handling, the code uses Rust's type system to prevent common errors (e.g., index out of bounds).
* **Areas for improvement:** None significant. Perhaps consider adding doc comments for external APIs.


Grade: A+


**C Implementation**

* **Correctness:** Correct.
* **Code Quality:** Good. Well-structured and readable for C.  Includes helpful comments.
* **Completeness:** Complete.
* **Error Handling:**  Lacks robust error handling for invalid inputs. Should check for null pointers and invalid array sizes.  `isAlphanumeric` helper function improves readability but should probably be static to limit its scope.
* **Areas for improvement**:
    * **Palindrome Checker:**  The `isPalindrome` function correctly skips non-alphanumeric characters, but using `isalnum` in this case returns `false` for multi byte unicode characters in the input string. Whilst not strictly part of the given requirements it might be useful to have documented the current behaviour of how these inputs are handled.
    * **Error Handling:**  The `binarySearch` function doesn't handle the case where the array is null or empty. This could lead to undefined behavior. Add checks for these conditions.
    * **Const Correctness:** Consider using `const` for parameters that aren't modified (e.g., `const char* s` in `isPalindrome`).  This would be more consistent for `binary_search` with `const int arr[]`.

Below is a detailed assessment for each language’s FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search implementations, followed by an overall letter grade.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) CORRECTNESS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• All four languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C) appear to implement the FizzBuzz logic correctly by printing “Fizz” for multiples of 3, “Buzz” for multiples of 5, “FizzBuzz” for multiples of 15, and the number otherwise.  
• Palindrome Checker correctly filters out non-alphanumeric characters, converts to lowercase, then compares the string to its reverse.  
• Binary Search implementations follow the standard pattern (while left ≤ right, compute mid, compare, and adjust bounds), returning -1 if not found or the index if found.

There are no obvious bugs or logical errors in any of the solutions. Edge cases like empty strings or arrays of length zero are safely handled (returning false for empty palindrome checks and -1 for binary searches).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) CODE QUALITY
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• All four versions follow their respective language conventions and use straightforward, idiomatic approaches.  
• Naming: function names and variable names are clear and descriptive in all implementations.  
• Readability: the code is well-structured, separated into logical functions or methods, and formatted consistently.  
• Overall, the code is easy to read and maintain.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) COMPLETENESS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Each of the three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) is implemented in all four languages, satisfying the requirement.  
• Example usage/test calls are included in every language, demonstrating core functionality.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) ERROR HANDLING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• For these particular tasks, heavy error handling is not strictly necessary.  
• In all implementations, potentially tricky edge cases (such as an empty string in Palindrome Checker or an empty array in Binary Search) do not cause runtime errors; the solutions gracefully return expected fallback results (false for empty palindrome checks, -1 for unfound elements).  
• Additional checks (like verifying sorted input for Binary Search) could be added for real-world robustness, but they are not required for classic coding exercises.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT / NOTES
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• TypeScript: No major issues. Optionally, one might consider returning a result array (e.g., collecting FizzBuzz outputs) instead of logging directly, if further processing is needed.  
• Python: Straightforward implementations. The binary_search function and is_palindrome function are idiomatic.  
• Rust: The binary_search function returns isize, which integrates cleanly with slices. One might consider returning Option<usize> for typical Rust style, but this is more a design preference than a correctness issue.  
• C: The code is direct and clear. The isPalindrome function uses manual pointer checks and tolower comparisons, which is perfectly acceptable in C. Additional checks for array size before binary search are non-essential but could be added for safety in production code.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
OVERALL EVALUATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These solutions are well-structured, correct, and complete. They adhere to best practices in their respective languages and handle typical edge cases appropriately.

Grade: A+

Below is a detailed review of each language’s implementation:

─────────────────────────────  
TypeScript Implementation

• Correctness:  
 – The FizzBuzz loop correctly iterates from 1 to 100 and uses the proper modulus checks (with 15 first then 3 and 5) to print the expected strings.  
 – The Palindrome Checker cleans the string (removing non-alphanumeric characters and lowercasing) and compares it to its reverse, which is correct.  
 – The Binary Search function properly computes the mid index and adjusts the left/right pointers. All functions behave as expected.

• Code Quality:  
 – The code is well-structured and functions are clearly named.  
 – It uses modern TypeScript conventions (such as let/const) and simple logic that is easy to follow.

• Completeness:  
 – All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search) are implemented.

• Error Handling:  
 – Although the examples don’t include explicit error checking (for instance, ensuring that the binary search array is sorted), this is acceptable for the demonstration. In a production scenario, one might validate inputs.

─────────────────────────────  
Python Implementation

• Correctness:  
 – FizzBuzz prints the correct output from 1 to 100 using the expected conditional order.  
 – The Palindrome Checker uses a regular expression to clean the input and then compares it with its reversed version correctly.  
 – The Binary Search function uses a standard algorithm that returns the correct index or –1.

• Code Quality:  
 – The code is concise, properly formatted, and uses descriptive function names.  
 – It follows Pythonic idioms and style.

• Completeness:  
 – All three problems are fully implemented in the Python script.

• Error Handling:  
 – There isn’t special handling for malformed inputs, but given the simplicity of the tasks, this is not a major concern here.

─────────────────────────────  
Rust Implementation

• Correctness:  
 – The FizzBuzz function uses an idiomatic match statement to decide what to print and covers all cases correctly.  
 – The Palindrome Checker correctly filters out non-alphanumeric characters and performs a case-insensitive comparison.  
 – The Binary Search function is implemented correctly, including careful conversion from indices to accommodate the isize type.

• Code Quality:  
 – The Rust code uses idiomatic constructs (such as iterators and match) and is well-structured and readable.  
 – Functions are separated cleanly and clearly showcase Rust’s capabilities.

• Completeness:  
 – The code implements all three problems as required.

• Error Handling:  
 – As with the other implementations, no extra error-handling is provided (for example, verifying that the input slice is sorted), but the simplicity of these examples means that this is acceptable.

─────────────────────────────  
C Implementation

• Correctness:  
 – The FizzBuzz loop correctly prints the expected strings for numbers 1 to 100.  
 – The Palindrome Checker uses a two-pointer approach, skipping non-alphanumeric characters and comparing in a case-insensitive manner.  
 – The Binary Search function is implemented with proper updates to the left and right indices and returns the correct result.

• Code Quality:  
 – The code is modularized into separate functions and uses helper functions (like isAlphanumeric) to improve clarity.  
 – It includes the necessary standard libraries and employs stdbool.h for booleans.  
 – One minor improvement could be to verify that the input string provided to isPalindrome isn’t NULL, though for demonstration purposes this is acceptable.

• Completeness:  
 – All three problems are fully implemented in C.

• Error Handling:  
 – There is minimal error handling in these sample implementations. For example, checking for NULL pointers when processing strings in C might be considered in production code. Nonetheless, for the purposes of demonstrating the algorithm, this is sufficient.

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Assessment

Each language implementation correctly and cleanly solves the three problems. The code in all cases follows the conventions and best practices of its language, and the solutions are complete across TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C.

Minor areas for improvement include:
 – Adding more robust input validation/error handling (especially in C, where a NULL pointer check for strings could be beneficial).
 – Optionally documenting that the Binary Search routines assume that the input arrays are already sorted.

Given these points, the implementations are solid, correctly structured, and very readable overall.
