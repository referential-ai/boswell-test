Here are the solutions for each programming problem in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C:

**FizzBuzz**

**TypeScript**
```typescript
function fizzBuzz(): void {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log('FizzBuzz');
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log('Fizz');
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log('Buzz');
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}

fizzBuzz();
```

**Python**
```python
def fizz_buzz():
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print('FizzBuzz')
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print('Fizz')
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print('Buzz')
        else:
            print(i)

fizz_buzz()
```

**Rust**
```rust
fn fizz_buzz() {
    for i in 1..101 {
        if i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0 {
            println!("FizzBuzz");
        } else if i % 3 == 0 {
            println!("Fizz");
        } else if i % 5 == 0 {
            println!("Buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", i);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    fizz_buzz();
}
```

**C**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void fizz_buzz() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
            printf("FizzBuzz\n");
        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            printf("Fizz\n");
        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            printf("Buzz\n");
        } else {
            printf("%d\n", i);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    fizz_buzz();
    return 0;
}
```

**Palindrome Checker**

**TypeScript**
```typescript
function isPalindrome(str: string): boolean {
  const cleanedStr = str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
  return cleanedStr === cleanedStr.split('').reverse().join('');
}

console.log(isPalindrome('A man, a plan, a canal: Panama')); // true
```

**Python**
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(e for e in s if e.isalnum()).lower()
    return s == s[::-1]

print(is_palindrome('A man, a plan, a canal: Panama'))  # True
```

**Rust**
```rust
use regex::Regex;

fn is_palindrome(s: &str) -> bool {
    let re = Regex::new(r"\W+").unwrap();
    let cleaned_str = re.replace_all(s, "").to_lowercase();
    cleaned_str.as_str() == cleaned_str.chars().rev().collect::<String>().as_str()
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // true
}
```

**C**
```c
#include <string.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int is_palindrome(const char *s) {
    char cleanedStr[256];
    int len = 0;
    while (*s) {
        if (isalnum(*s)) {
            cleanedStr[len++] = tolower(*s);
        }
        s++;
    }
    cleanedStr[len] = '\0';
    int i = 0, j = len - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        if (cleanedStr[i]!= cleanedStr[j]) {
            return 0;
        }
        i++;
        j--;
    }
    return 1;
}

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")); // 1
    return 0;
}
```

**Binary Search**

**TypeScript**
```typescript
function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
console.log(binarySearch(arr, 7)); // 6
```

**Python**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(binary_search(arr, 7))  # 6
```

**Rust**
```rust
fn binary_search(arr: &[i32], target: i32) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut left = 0;
    let mut right = arr.len() - 1;
    while left <= right {
        let mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if arr[mid] == target {
            return Some(mid);

    match binary_search(&arr, 7) {
        Some(index) => println!("Found at index {}", index),
        None => println!("Not found"),
    }
}
```

**C**
```c
int binary_search(int arr[], int target, int len) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = len - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

# Evaluation of Programming Solutions

## TypeScript Implementations

### FizzBuzz (TypeScript)
The implementation is correct and follows standard TypeScript conventions. It properly handles all three cases (multiples of 3, multiples of 5, and multiples of both 3 and 5) and prints numbers otherwise. The code is concise and readable.

### Palindrome Checker (TypeScript)
The solution correctly checks if a string is a palindrome by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase. The regex pattern and string manipulation functions are used appropriately. The solution demonstrates good use of TypeScript's string methods.

### Binary Search (TypeScript)
The binary search implementation is correct with the proper loop condition and midpoint calculation. The function returns -1 when the target is not found, which is a common convention. The code is well-structured with clear variable names.

## Python Implementations

### FizzBuzz (Python)
The Python implementation follows Python's naming conventions (snake_case) and uses the range function appropriately for the loop. The logic is correct and the code is readable.

### Palindrome Checker (Python)
The solution correctly uses a list comprehension to filter out non-alphanumeric characters. The string slicing syntax `s[::-1]` is a Pythonic way to reverse a string. This is an elegant implementation that follows Python's conventions.

### Binary Search (Python)
The binary search implementation in Python follows proper conventions and correctly implements the algorithm. The floor division operator `//` is appropriately used for the midpoint calculation.

## Rust Implementations

### FizzBuzz (Rust)
The Rust implementation follows Rust naming conventions and correctly implements the FizzBuzz logic. The use of the `println!` macro is appropriate.

### Palindrome Checker (Rust)
The solution uses the Regex crate, which is an external dependency that isn't shown in the imports. This could cause compilation errors without the proper setup. The implementation correctly handles non-alphanumeric characters and case sensitivity. The use of Rust's iterator methods like `chars().rev().collect()` is idiomatic.

### Binary Search (Rust)
The Rust implementation returns an `Option<usize>` instead of a negative number, which is more idiomatic in Rust. It correctly handles the loop conditions and updates. The match expression in the main function is a good Rust practice for handling Options.

## C Implementations

### FizzBuzz (C)
The C implementation correctly implements the FizzBuzz algorithm. The code follows standard C conventions and uses appropriate formatting with `printf`.

### Palindrome Checker (C)
The implementation has a potential buffer overflow issue - the `cleanedStr` array has a fixed size of 256 bytes, which might not be enough for very long input strings. The logic for checking palindromes using two pointers is correct. The code also correctly uses `isalnum()` and `tolower()` from the C standard library.

Additionally, the code is missing a `#include <stdio.h>` for the `printf` function in the `main` function.

### Binary Search (C)
The C implementation correctly passes the array length as a parameter since C arrays don't carry their length information. However, in the main function, the output doesn't handle the case where the target isn't found, which could be misleading if the returned index is -1.

## Overall Assessment

### Correctness
All implementations appear to work as expected, with the minor caveat about the potential buffer overflow in the C palindrome checker.

### Code Quality
The code generally follows language conventions and best practices. Variable names are descriptive, and the logic is clear. The Rust palindrome checker assumes the regex crate is available, which might not be the case without proper setup.

### Completeness
All three problems are implemented in all four languages.

### Error Handling
- TypeScript and Python: Basic error handling is appropriate for these simple examples.
- Rust: The Option type in binary search is good for error handling.
- C: The palindrome checker has a potential buffer overflow issue, and the binary search doesn't handle the "not found" case well in its main function.

## Specific Issues and Improvements

1. C Palindrome Checker: Add dynamic memory allocation or input validation to prevent buffer overflow.
2. C Palindrome Checker: Add missing `#include <stdio.h>` for the printf function.
3. C Binary Search: Improve the main function to handle the case where the target is not found.
4. Rust Palindrome Checker: Add error handling for the regex creation or use a different approach that doesn't rely on external dependencies.

4. **Error Handling**: The implementation returns `Option<usize>` which is a good practice for handling the case where the target is not found. However, no error handling is provided for invalid input.

**C**
1. **Correctness**: The implementation is correct and works as expected.
2. **Code Quality**: The code follows C conventions and is well-structured. The use of integer division (`/`) for calculating the midpoint is typical for C. A function comment would improve readability and maintainability.
3. **Completeness**: Implemented correctly.
4. **Error Handling**: The function does not handle potential errors such as invalid input. Adding input validation would improve robustness.

### FizzBuzz (TypeScript)
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly prints "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both, and the number itself otherwise.

**Code Quality**: Excellent. The code follows TypeScript conventions with proper typing (`void` return type), uses strict equality checks (`===`), and has clear, logical structure.

**Error Handling**: Not applicable for this problem.

### Palindrome Checker (TypeScript)
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly removes non-alphanumeric characters, converts to lowercase, and compares the string with its reverse.

**Code Quality**: Very good. The regex approach is clean and the string manipulation methods are used appropriately.

**Error Handling**: No validation for empty strings or `null`/`undefined` inputs, which would be an improvement.

### Binary Search (TypeScript)
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly finds the target value or returns -1 if not found.

**Code Quality**: Good use of variables and logical structure. The `Math.floor()` ensures correct calculation of the middle index.

**Error Handling**: No validation that the input array is sorted, which is a prerequisite for binary search.

**Overall TypeScript Assessment**: The implementations are correct and follow TypeScript conventions. Minor improvements could include input validation.

```
Grade: A
```

## Python Implementations

### FizzBuzz (Python)
**Correctness**: The implementation correctly handles all cases using the appropriate range.

### Evaluation of FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C

---

### **FizzBuzz**

#### **TypeScript**

- **Error Handling**: The function assumes the input array is sorted but does not validate this.

#### **C**
- **Correctness**: The implementation is correct and functions as expected.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows C conventions. The use of `sizeof` to calculate the array length is appropriate.
- **Completeness**: The problem is fully implemented.
- **Error Handling**: The function assumes the input array is sorted and does not validate this.

---

### **Overall Assessment**

- **Correctness**: All implementations work as expected. No bugs or logic errors were found.
- **Code Quality**: The code in all languages follows language-specific conventions and is readable. However, some minor improvements could be made (e.g., removing the regex dependency in Rust for Palindrome Checker).
- **Completeness**: All three problems are implemented in all four languages.
- **Error Handling**: While the implementations generally handle their tasks well, some lack robust error handling (e.g., handling invalid inputs). However, this is a minor concern given the well-defined nature of the problems.

## Graded by: Gemini Flash 2.0

Okay, I will evaluate the submitted code based on the criteria defined: Correctness, Code Quality, Completeness, and Error Handling.

**FizzBuzz**

*   **TypeScript:** Correct and follows convention.
*   **Python:** Correct and readable.
*   **Rust:** Correct and idiomatic Rust.
*   **C:** Correct and standard C implementation.

**Palindrome Checker**

*   **TypeScript:** Correct, uses regex for non-alphanumeric removal which is appropriate.
*   **Python:** Correct and concise.
*   **Rust:** Correct, uses regex, which is acceptable.
*   **C:** Correct and avoids dynamic memory allocation, good for embedded scenarios.  However, the fixed buffer size `cleanedStr[256]` could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string, after special character removal has length >= 256.

**Binary Search**

*   **TypeScript:** Correct and standard implementation.
*   **Python:** Correct implementation.
*   **Rust:** Correct and uses `Option<usize>` which is the more Rust-like way to indicate a potentially missing value.
*   **C:** Correct implementation and well-commented.

**Completeness**

All three problems are implemented across all four languages.

**Error Handling**

*  **FizzBuzz**: No explicit error handling needed, so the implementations are acceptable.
*  **Palindrome**: No specific error scenarios requiring explicit handling, so the implementations are passable. The C Version *could* overflow if input is too large.
*   **Binary Search**:
    *   Rust utilizes Result/Option types to handle scenarios where the element is not found, reflecting best practice error usage via the standard libraries error handling.
    *   The TypeScript, Python, and C implementations properly return -1 when the target isn't found which is a reasonable way to denote 'not found'. No explicit error handling but acceptable.

**Summary of Issues/Improvements**

*   **C Palindrome:** Introduce a length check of the input string before cleaning it to avoid potential buffer overflow issue.

Overall, the code is functional and generally well-written, demonstrating a good understanding of the problem domains and language paradigms. The Rust implementation of binary search utilizes Rust's `Option` type appropriately, demonstrating awareness of best practices for handling potentially missing values. The C implementation of Palindrome has a potential for buffer overflow, which should be addressed.

Grade: B+


**Letter Grade:** B+
**Numeric Grade:** 3.3

## Graded by: Gemini Pro 1.5

**FizzBuzz**

All FizzBuzz implementations are correct and produce the expected output.

* **TypeScript:** Clean, follows conventions, good use of `let` and type safety.
* **Python:**  Pythonic and concise.
* **Rust:** Uses the range correctly, clear and efficient.
* **C:** Standard C, clear and concise.

Grade: A

**Palindrome Checker**

* **TypeScript:** Correct and efficient.  Good use of regex and built-in functions.
* **Python:** Concise and leverages Python's string manipulation features effectively.
* **Rust:**  Correct, but the dependency on an external crate (regex) for a simple task like this is overkill. A simpler solution using built-in string methods would be preferred.
* **C:** Correct, handles case and non-alphanumeric characters properly.  However, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability—the `cleanedStr` buffer has a fixed size.  This needs a bounds check or dynamic allocation.

Grade: B+

**Binary Search**

* **TypeScript:** Correct implementation of binary search. The type annotations enhance readability.
* **Python:** Pythonic, clear, and correct.
* **Rust:**  Correct and idiomatic use of `Option` for handling the case where the target is not found.
* **C:** Correct and efficient. Includes necessary length parameter for the array.

Grade: A


Overall assessment:  The code is generally well-written and mostly follows best practices. The main area of concern is the potential buffer overflow in the C palindrome checker.  The Rust palindrome checker's reliance on an external crate is also not ideal for such a simple task.

Grade: A-


**Letter Grade:** A

## Graded by: DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-32b

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Correctness**:
   - FizzBuzz: All implementations correctly print Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz, or the number. No issues.
   - Palindrome Checker: TypeScript, Python, and C implementations correctly ignore non-alphanumeric characters and case. Rust's implementation uses a regex that may incorrectly retain underscores, leading to potential incorrect results. Thus, Rust has a correctness issue.
   - Binary Search: All implementations correctly find the target index or return -1. No issues.

2. **Code Quality**:
   - All languages use clear, concise, and idiomatic code. Rust's Palindrome checker has a minor code quality issue due to the regex choice, which doesn't align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Completeness**:
   - All three problems are implemented in all four languages. Complete.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling is implicit but sufficient for the provided use cases. No significant issues identified.

## Graded by: o1

Below is a detailed evaluation of each set of solutions according to the requested criteria: correctness, code quality, completeness, and error handling. At the end, you’ll find the overall letter grade.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) TypeScript
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• FizzBuzz
  – Correctness: Works as expected. Correctly prints “Fizz”, “Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz” according to the problem’s rules.
  – Code Quality: Follows typical TypeScript/JavaScript control structure patterns well. Readable and straightforward.
  – Completeness: Fully implements FizzBuzz from 1 to 100.
  – Error Handling: Not required for this task. The logic is simple, and the implementation is appropriate.

• Palindrome Checker
  – Correctness: Uses a regular expression to remove non-alphanumeric characters and then compares the cleaned string with its reverse. Correctly identifies palindromes.
  – Code Quality: Good use of built-in string functions (replace, toLowerCase, etc.). The implementation is concise and clear.
  – Completeness: Demonstrates functionality with a standard test case.
  – Error Handling: No explicit error handling for empty or null strings, but for most practical use cases it behaves correctly.

• Binary Search
  – Correctness: Implements the standard binary search algorithm. Returns the correct index or -1 if not found.
  – Code Quality: Readable and idiomatic TypeScript with a simple while loop for search. 
  – Completeness: Demonstrates functionality with an example array and logs the correct index.
  – Error Handling: No handling of edge cases like an empty array, but the code’s main logic is accurate for typical use.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) Python
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• FizzBuzz
  – Correctness: Logic mirrors the standard rules. Outputs the correct strings for multiples of 3 and/or 5.
  – Code Quality: Very succinct and Pythonic. Uses range(1, 101).
  – Completeness: Fully solves the problem from 1 to 100.
  – Error Handling: Not an issue for this type of problem.

• Palindrome Checker
  – Correctness: Removes non-alphanumeric characters with a generator expression and compares the cleaned string against its reverse slice.
  – Code Quality: Clear, idiomatic Python. Straightforward solution. 
  – Completeness: Includes a test print statement that verifies the function’s correctness.
  – Error Handling: Minimal, but the function handles typical string inputs well.

• Binary Search
  – Correctness: Standard Python binary search using (left + right) // 2. Returns the correct index or -1 if the element is not found.
  – Code Quality: Well-structured. Variable names are clear.
  – Completeness: Demonstrates by searching for a value in a sample array.
  – Error Handling: No additional handling for empty lists, but in normal cases, it works correctly.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Rust
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• FizzBuzz
  – Correctness: Correctly implements the FizzBuzz logic with a for loop from 1..101.
  – Code Quality: Idiomatic Rust for loop, println! usage, and simple conditions. Very clear.
  – Completeness: Covers 1 to 100 as required.
  – Error Handling: None needed beyond standard control flow for this problem.

• Palindrome Checker
  – Correctness: Uses a regex to strip out non-word characters, then checks if the cleaned string equals its reverse. Correctly identifies palindromes.
  – Code Quality: Code is concise, but unwrap() is called on Regex::new, which could potentially panic if the expression failed to compile. In practice, the regex is straightforward and should not fail at runtime.
  – Completeness: Demonstrates functionality by printing the boolean result.
  – Error Handling: Could handle regex creation errors more gracefully, but this is minor in a small example.

• Binary Search
  – Correctness: Correctly returns Some(index) if the target is found and None if not. Uses a standard binary search loop with while left <= right.
  – Code Quality: Nicely written with Option<usize> as the return type, which is idiomatic in Rust for indicating presence or absence.
  – Completeness: Demonstrates usage with a test array in main.
  – Error Handling: No explicit checks for an empty slice (arr.len() - 1 could panic if arr.is_empty()). This is typically the caller’s responsibility in Rust, but worth noting.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) C
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• FizzBuzz
  – Correctness: Uses a classic for loop and printf to print the correct output from 1 to 100.
  – Code Quality: Straightforward approach, well-structured.
  – Completeness: Complete solution from 1 to 100.
  – Error Handling: None required here.

• Palindrome Checker
  – Correctness: Reads characters, filters out non-alphanumeric using isalnum, converts to lowercase, and then checks indices from both ends. Correctly identifies palindromes.
  – Code Quality: Reasonable approach, but a fixed-size buffer (char cleanedStr[256]) could cause issues if the input string is larger. Also, it is done in main with a simple test.
  – Completeness: The logic is correct for the tested scenario.
  – Error Handling: Does not handle input strings longer than 255 characters (plus the null terminator). Could lead to buffer overflow. Consider using safer dynamic allocation or checking lengths before writing.

• Binary Search
  – Correctness: Implements the standard iterative binary search. Returns the correct index or -1 if not found.
  – Code Quality: Straight, minimal C code. 
  – Completeness: Uses an example array to demonstrate functionality.
  – Error Handling: Similar to the other examples, no checks for zero-length arrays, but this is generally acceptable at this level.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary & Areas for Improvement
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• All solutions for all languages implement FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search correctly and completely.  
• Code quality is generally good and follows standard idioms in each language.
• Error handling is minimal (which is typical in small examples), but in a production context, each implementation could benefit from additional checks (e.g., handling empty arrays, potential panics or buffer overruns, etc.).
• The C palindrome checker’s biggest limitation is the fixed buffer size of 256 characters, which can lead to overflow if the input is very large.

Overall, these solutions are well-done across the board with only minor suggestions for robustness.

## Graded by: o3-mini-high

Below is a detailed evaluation of each implementation across the three problems and four languages:

─────────────────────────────  
1. FizzBuzz

• TypeScript  
 – Correctness: The loop from 1 to 100 and conditional tests (checking 3, 5, and both) are implemented correctly.  
 – Code Quality: The code is clear, well-indented, and adheres to common TypeScript practices.  
 – Completeness & Error Handling: The solution meets the requirements; no error handling is needed for a well‐defined loop.

• Python  
 – Correctness: The use of range(1, 101) and correct conditional ordering guarantee accurate FizzBuzz behavior.  
 – Code Quality: The code is concise and adheres to standard Python style.  
 – Completeness & Error Handling: The solution is complete. No exceptional conditions need handling.

• Rust  
 – Correctness: The use of “for i in 1..101” is correct (it goes from 1 to 100) and the conditions are in the proper order.  
 – Code Quality: The code is straightforward and idiomatic.  
 – Completeness & Error Handling: Error handling isn’t required for this task, and the implementation is complete.

• C  
 – Correctness: The loop and conditions are correctly implemented, and printf produces the expected output.  
 – Code Quality: The C implementation is simple and clear.  
 – Completeness & Error Handling: Complete for the given task; no additional error handling is needed.

─────────────────────────────  
2. Palindrome Checker

• TypeScript  
 – Correctness: The function cleans the string by removing non-alphanumeric characters and lowercases it before checking against its reverse.  
 – Code Quality: The use of regular expressions and array methods is idiomatic.  
 – Completeness: Meets the problem specification with one clear example.  
 – Error Handling: No explicit error cases are handled (e.g., very long strings), but that is acceptable for this scope.

• Python  
 – Correctness: The code correctly filters out non-alphanumeric characters and compares the cleaned string with its reverse (using slicing).  
 – Code Quality: It uses a generator expression and string methods in a Pythonic way.  
 – Completeness & Error Handling: The solution is complete; error handling isn’t required given the problem constraints.

• Rust  
 – Correctness: The function uses the regex crate to remove non-word characters and then checks the reversed string. One minor point is that the regular expression (r"\W+") removes non-alphanumeric characters but will keep underscores (since they are considered “word” characters) which may or may not be desired.  
 – Code Quality: The code is concise and idiomatic. Using unwrap for compiling the regex is acceptable in this controlled context, though a more robust solution might handle the potential error explicitly.  
 – Completeness: The example in main confirms the functionality.  
 – Error Handling: There is a forced unwrap for the regex creation that could be made safer in a production code base.

• C  
 – Correctness: The implementation cleans the string by checking characters with isalnum and tolower, then compares characters from the beginning and end.  
 – Code Quality: While the code is straightforward, it uses a fixed-size buffer (256 bytes) without checking input length, which might become an issue with larger inputs.  
 – Completeness: The problem requirement is met with proper function and demonstration in main.  
 – Error Handling: There is no handling for potential buffer overflow, so it would be prudent to either limit input length or use a dynamically allocated buffer in a robust solution.

─────────────────────────────  
3. Binary Search

• TypeScript  
 – Correctness: The iterative approach calculates the mid correctly and adjusts left/right indices properly.  
 – Code Quality: The solution is clean and follows standard TypeScript conventions.  
 – Completeness: The code includes a simple test case.  
 – Error Handling: No explicit error handling is required as the function returns –1 when the target isn’t found.

• Python  
 – Correctness: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly with integer division and proper boundaries.  
 – Code Quality: The code is clear and uses standard Python constructs.  
 – Completeness & Error Handling: The solution returns –1 when the target does not exist, which suffices for this problem.

• Rust  
 – Correctness: The algorithm is implemented correctly for a nonempty slice. However, if an empty slice is passed, calculating arr.len() – 1 could lead to an underflow.  
 – Code Quality: The code is idiomatic, and returning an Option is a good practice.  
 – Completeness: The example in main covers a normal case; a check for an empty array would make it more robust.  
 – Error Handling: It would be beneficial to handle the empty slice case explicitly to prevent potential panics.

• C  
 – Correctness: The C implementation is standard and returns the correct index if the target is found, and –1 otherwise.  
 – Code Quality: The code is written in a clear, procedural style.  
 – Completeness: All elements of binary search are covered with a working main demonstration.  
 – Error Handling: No specific error handling is in place; one might consider safer arithmetic to avoid overflow in larger arrays, but it is acceptable for this controlled example.

Overall Assessment

All three problems are implemented in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C, demonstrating completeness across the board. The solutions are largely correct and closely follow each language’s idioms and best practices. Notable areas for improvement include:

– In Rust’s binary search, handling an empty array would prevent potential underflow.
– In the Rust palindrome checker, consider whether keeping underscores is acceptable.
– In C implementations (especially for the Palindrome Checker), reliance on fixed buffer sizes without boundary checks may be risky for inputs longer than expected.
– Across all languages, while error handling is minimal, it is generally acceptable given these are self-contained examples.

Taking into account correctness, code quality, completeness, and minor gaps in error handling, the overall grade for these submissions is:

Grade: A-

**Letter Grade:** A-
**Numeric Grade:** 3.7
