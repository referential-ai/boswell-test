Below are complete, self-contained implementations of the requested problems in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C. Each section includes:

• FizzBuzz  
• Palindrome Checker  
• Binary Search  

All code should run as-is (with appropriate compilation or interpretation) and follow typical language conventions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) TYPESCRIPT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Create a file named "solutions.ts" (or any .ts file) and compile/run with tsc/node.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"use strict";

/**
 * 1) FizzBuzz
 * Prints numbers 1 through 100, but:
 *  - For multiples of 3, prints 'Fizz'
 *  - For multiples of 5, prints 'Buzz'
 *  - For multiples of both 3 and 5, prints 'FizzBuzz'
 */
function fizzBuzzTS(): void {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    const isMultipleOf3 = (i % 3 === 0);
    const isMultipleOf5 = (i % 5 === 0);
    
    if (isMultipleOf3 && isMultipleOf5) {
      console.log("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (isMultipleOf3) {
      console.log("Fizz");
    } else if (isMultipleOf5) {
      console.log("Buzz");
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
}

/**
 * 2) Palindrome Checker
 * Returns true if the string is a palindrome (ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters),
 * false otherwise.
 */

  // Check if filtered string is a palindrome
  let left = 0;
  let right = filtered.length - 1;

    if (filtered[left] !== filtered[right]) {
      return false;
    }
    left++;
    right--;
  }
  return true;
}

/**
 * 3) Binary Search (iterative)
 * @param arr sorted array of numbers
 * @param target the number to find
 * @returns index of target in arr, or -1 if not found
 */
function binarySearchTS(arr: number[], target: number): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);

### TypeScript

1. **Correctness**: 
    - FizzBuzz is implemented correctly, printing results as expected from 1 to 100.
    - Palindrome Checker accurately compares strings and considers only alphanumeric characters, ignoring cases.
    - Binary Search correctly implements the iterative search and returns the appropriate index or -1.
   
2. **Code Quality**: 
    - The code generally follows TypeScript conventions, utilizing types and appropriate iteration techniques.
    - The use of `const` and `let` for variable declaration is good practice, enhancing readability.

3. **Completeness**: 
    - All three problems are implemented correctly.

4. **Error Handling**: 
    - There is no explicit error handling, which is typical for simple scripts like these, but TypeScript’s type system helps in basic checks.

**Improvements**: Consider handling edge cases such as empty inputs or large numbers in binary search for robustness. Adding comments for complex steps would improve understandability.

```
Grade: A
```

### Python

1. **Correctness**: 
    - FizzBuzz is correct, producing the required output.
    - Palindrome Checker handles case sensitivity and ignores non-alphanumeric characters appropriately.
    - Binary Search performs correctly with an iterative approach, returning the correct index or -1.
   
2. **Code Quality**: 
    - Python code is clear and uses conventional idiomatics like list comprehensions.
    - Function annotations for types are good but could be added to the `binary_search_py` for consistency.

3. **Completeness**: 
    - All three functions are implemented and included in the `main_py` function for demonstration.

4. **Error Handling**: 
    - No explicit error handling is implemented. For simplicity’s sake, this is acceptable, but edge cases for empty lists in binary search might be handled in practice.

**Improvements**: Adding more comments could enhance clarity, and additional checks for empty or invalid input could improve robustness.

```
Grade: A
```

### Rust

1. **Correctness**: 
    - FizzBuzz works correctly.
    - Palindrome Checker correctly filters and checks palindromes.
    - Binary Search iterates properly over the input array and returns correct results.
   
2. **Code Quality**: 
    - The code mostly follows idiomatic Rust; however, a more consistent use of `saturating_sub`/`saturating_add` in binary search is seen as a strong safeguard.
    - Usage of match in FizzBuzz is a good Rust-specific design choice.

3. **Completeness**: 
    - Each problem implementation is included.

4. **Error Handling**: 
    - Binary search precludes panic from underflow/overflow with `saturating` methods. This illustrates awareness of potential runtime panics and manages them cautiously.

**Improvements**: Adding even more idiomatic elements like `slice` patterns could optimize Rust usage further.

```
Grade: A-
```

### C

1. **Correctness**: 
    - FizzBuzz produces the correct results.
    - Palindrome Checker operates well with the char-specific manipulation.
    - Binary Search works as expected to locate the correct index or return -1.
   
2. **Code Quality**: 
    - The code is generally well-structured.
    - Correct usage of standard C libraries and data manipulation techniques, though `1024` in `isPalindromeC` magic numbers should ideally be defined as a constant.

3. **Completeness**: 
    - All implementations are present and correctly executed within `main`.

4. **Error Handling**: 
    - Beyond basic logic, there is a lack of error handling, though such checks are less common in straightforward C scripts like this.

**Improvements**: Using `size_t` for array indices and sizes could prevent issues on different architectures.

```
Grade: B+
```

**Letter Grade:** A
**Numeric Grade:** 4.0

## Graded by: GPT-4o-mini

Let's evaluate the provided implementations for the three problems: FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C.

### 1) TypeScript

#### Correctness
- **FizzBuzz**: Correctly implements the logic for Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Properly filters non-alphanumeric characters and checks for palindromes. Works as expected.
- **Binary Search**: Correct implementation of the binary search algorithm. Returns the correct index or -1.

#### Code Quality
- The TypeScript code is well-structured, uses strict type annotations, and follows best practices (e.g., `const` for constants).
- The use of template strings for console logging is missing, which can improve readability.

#### Completeness
- All three problems are implemented correctly.

#### Error Handling
- There's no explicit error handling for invalid input in the palindrome checker (like handling `null` strings), but since TypeScript has type safety, it’s generally safe.

### Areas for Improvement:
- Consider adding input validation for `isPalindromeTS`.
- Use template literals for logging consistency.

---

### 2) Python

#### Correctness
- **FizzBuzz**: Correctly implements the required behavior.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Correct and follows the required logic.
- **Binary Search**: Correct implementation, returning -1 for not found.

#### Code Quality
- The code is Pythonic; list comprehensions are used effectively.
- It can benefit from function docstrings to clarify expected input and output.

#### Completeness
- All three problems are present and implemented correctly.

#### Error Handling
- No error handling exists for unexpected input types (e.g., `None` or non-string for palindrome).

### Areas for Improvement:
- Add input validation and error handling, especially for the palindrome function.
- Include docstrings for clarity.

---

### 3) Rust

#### Correctness
- **FizzBuzz**: Implements the functionality correctly.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Correctly filters input and checks for palindromes.
- **Binary Search**: Implements binary search correctly, although there may be unnecessary checks for underflow.

#### Code Quality
- The use of `match` for conditionals in FizzBuzz is idiomatic and enhances clarity.
- The filtering process in palindrome is clean.
- The use of `saturating_sub` for subtracting avoids potential underflows.

#### Completeness
- All three problems are implemented.

#### Error Handling
- The code lacks error handling for inputs of incorrect types or unexpected conditions.

### Areas for Improvement:
- Improve the comments and documentation in the code for clarity.
- Add error handling for unexpected inputs.

---

### 4) C

#### Correctness
- **FizzBuzz**: Implementation is correct.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Validates and checks for palindromes correctly, but it may cause buffer overflow if the input string exceeds 1024 characters.
- **Binary Search**: Implements the algorithm correctly, including edge cases.

#### Code Quality
- The code follows C conventions reasonably well (e.g., naming, style).
- The use of a fixed-size buffer for the filtered string is a potential risk and not very flexible.

#### Completeness
- All three problems are fully implemented.

#### Error Handling
- The C implementation does not handle cases where input strings might be too long. There’s also no check for NULL pointers as input.

### Areas for Improvement:
- Implement dynamic memory allocation for the filtered string in the palindrome function to handle longer inputs.
- Include checks for NULL pointers.

### Code Quality
- Excellent code structure with clear function names and appropriate comments.
- Good use of TypeScript features like type annotations.
- Code follows TypeScript conventions.
- Variable names are descriptive and meaningful.
- The code calculates mid-point properly to avoid integer overflow: `Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2)`.

### Completeness
- All three problems are implemented correctly.

- Basic error handling is present.
- Could improve by adding input validation for each function.
- Binary search could check if the input array is sorted or empty.

Overall, the TypeScript code is well-written and follows good practices.

```
Grade: A
```

## 2) Python Solution

### Correctness
- FizzBuzz: Correctly implements the FizzBuzz logic.
- Palindrome Checker: Uses a nice pythonic approach with string slicing for palindrome checking.
- Binary Search: Correctly implements binary search.

### Code Quality
- Clean and concise, making use of Python's features (list comprehension, slicing).
- Good use of type annotations for improved readability.
- Docstrings are present and descriptive.

### Completeness
- All three problems are implemented correctly.

### Error Handling
- Binary search function could benefit from more input validation.
- No handling for empty arrays or non-numeric inputs in binary search.

The Python solution is very elegant and takes advantage of Python's features effectively.

```
Grade: A
```

## 3) Rust Solution

### Correctness
- FizzBuzz: Correctly implements FizzBuzz using Rust's pattern matching.
- Palindrome Checker: Correctly identifies palindromes.
- Binary Search: The implementation has a potential issue with the `wrapping_sub(1)` - while it prevents overflow, using it without checking if `bytes.len()` is 0 could lead to logical errors. The function also uses saturating operations to prevent overflow/underflow, which is good.

### Code Quality
- Code leverages Rust's strengths like pattern matching and iterator methods.
- Good use of Rust's safety features.
- The binary search includes a check to avoid underflow when `mid` is 0, which is necessary.

### Completeness
- All three problems are implemented.

### Error Handling
- Good use of Rust's safety features like `saturating_sub` to prevent integer underflow.
- The explicit check for `mid == 0` avoids potential underflow issues.
- Could improve boundary case handling in the palindrome function.

The Rust solution is solid with good attention to overflow/underflow prevention.

```
Grade: A-
```

## 4) C Solution

### Correctness
- FizzBuzz: Correctly implements FizzBuzz.
- Palindrome Checker: Has a major issue - the fixed-size buffer (1024 chars) could lead to buffer overflow if the input string is longer.
- Binary Search: Correctly implements binary search.

### Code Quality
- Good naming conventions and comments.
- Code is well-structured with clear functions.
- Proper use of C language features.

### Completeness
- All three problems are implemented.

### Error Handling
- The palindrome function has a fixed-size buffer that could cause overflow - this is a significant security vulnerability.
- The function does check to ensure it doesn't write beyond the buffer (with `idx < 1023`), but there's no warning if truncation occurs.
- No validation of inputs in binary search function.
- The code doesn't check for NULL inputs, which could cause undefined behavior.

The C solution implements the algorithms correctly but has significant issues with buffer management that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

```
Grade: B-
```

## Overall Assessment

All four language implementations correctly solve the three problems, but with varying degrees of safety and robustness. The TypeScript and Python implementations are the most polished, while the C implementation has potential security issues due to buffer management. The Rust implementation shows good attention to overflow/underflow prevention but could be improved for some edge cases.

**Letter Grade:** A
**Numeric Grade:** 4.0

## Graded by: Claude-3-Opus

Here is my assessment of the provided programming solutions in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C:

1) Correctness: 
The implementations for FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search appear to work as expected in all four languages. I did not identify any bugs or logic errors in the code.

2) Code Quality:
The code generally follows common conventions and best practices for each language. It is well-structured, readable, and properly documented with comments. A few minor notes:

- In the TypeScript solution, the type annotations could be more specific (e.g., `string[]` instead of `any[]` for the filtered array in `isPalindromeTS`). 
- The Python solution is clean and concise, making good use of language features like list comprehensions and slices.
- The Rust solution is idiomatic, utilizing pattern matching, iterators, and type inference effectively. The `saturating_add/sub` methods avoid overflow/underflow issues.
- The C solution properly handles string manipulation and uses appropriate types. It includes necessary headers and avoids potential buffer overflow in `isPalindromeC`.

3) Completeness:
All three problems (FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, Binary Search) are fully implemented in all four requested languages (TypeScript, Python, Rust, C). The solutions are complete and include example usage in a main/driver function.

4) Error Handling:
The code handles potential errors appropriately:

- TypeScript: Type annotations catch type-related issues. Bounds checks prevent out-of-bounds access.
- Python: The functions assume valid input types (no explicit error handling). Bounds checks are handled by the language.
- Rust: The `saturating_add/sub` methods gracefully handle potential overflow/underflow in `binary_search_rust`. Bounds checks prevent invalid access.
- C: The `isPalindromeC` function avoids buffer overflow when creating the filtered string copy. Bounds checks in `binarySearchC` prevent invalid array access.

The code could potentially add more explicit error handling, such as checking for `null`/`None`/`nil` inputs or handling allocation failures in C, but the current implementations are sufficient for the problems at hand.

Overall, the solutions demonstrate a strong understanding of the respective languages and the ability to implement common algorithms correctly and efficiently. The code is of high quality and follows best practices.

Grade: A

- The palindrome function handles empty strings correctly

```
Grade: A-
```

## 4) C

### Correctness
All implementations are correct.

### Code Quality
- Good structure with clear function organization
- Effective use of boolean variables in FizzBuzz
- Well-commented code that follows C conventions
- Binary search uses `left + (right - left) / 2` to avoid overflow

### Completeness
All three problems are implemented with proper demonstration in main.

### Error Handling
- Excellent buffer overflow prevention in the palindrome checker
- Proper use of `unsigned char` casts when using `isalnum` and `tolower`
- Fixed-size buffer (1024 bytes) in palindrome checker could be a limitation for extremely long strings
- No input validation for null pointers, though this is common in C

```
Grade: A-
```

## Overall Assessment

All implementations are highly competent, with each language implementation showing appropriate use of language idioms and conventions. The TypeScript and Python implementations edge ahead slightly in terms of readability and elegance, while the Rust and C implementations show careful attention to memory and overflow issues typical of systems programming languages.

The slight issues in Rust (unnecessary check in binary search) and C (fixed buffer size) are minor and don't significantly impact the overall quality.

function fizzBuzzTS(): void {
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    const isMultipleOf3 = (i % 3 === 0);
    const isMultipleOf5 = (i % 5 === 0);
    
    if (isMultipleOf3 && isMultipleOf5) {

### Evaluation of TypeScript Implementation

#### **Correctness:**
- **FizzBuzz:** Correct. The logic for checking multiples of 3 and 5 works properly, and the output is as expected.
- **Palindrome Checker:** Correct. The function successfully filters out non-alphanumeric characters and checks if the string is a palindrome, ignoring case.
- **Binary Search:** Correct. The iterative binary search works as expected, finding the correct index or returning `-1` if the target is not found.

#### **Code Quality:**
- The code follows TypeScript conventions and best practices.
- The use of type annotations (`: boolean`, `: number[]`) enhances readability and correctness.
- The structure is clear, with each function handling a single responsibility.
- Comments are concise and informative.

#### **Completeness:**
- All three problems are implemented and complete.

#### **Error Handling:**
- The binary search function assumes the input array is sorted, which is reasonable for the problem scope. However, no explicit check is performed to ensure the array is sorted.
- The palindrome checker does not handle excessively long strings (e.g., over 2^31-1 characters), but this is an edge case unlikely to occur.

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- Add a check to ensure the input array for binary search is sorted.
- Consider handling extremely long strings in the palindrome checker by using streaming or chunked processing.

```
Grade: A
```

### Evaluation of Python Implementation

#### **Correctness:**
- **FizzBuzz:** Correct. The logic is straightforward and produces the expected output.
- **Palindrome Checker:** Correct. The function filters out non-alphanumeric characters and checks for palindromes efficiently.
- **Binary Search:** Correct. The implementation is standard and works as expected.

#### **Code Quality:**
- The code adheres to Python conventions and is highly readable.
- The use of list comprehensions and slicing for the palindrome checker is idiomatic and concise.
- Functions are well-structured, with clear separation of concerns.

#### **Completeness:**
- All three problems are implemented and complete.

#### **Error Handling:**
- Similar to the TypeScript implementation, the binary search function assumes the input list is sorted but does not explicitly check for this.
- The palindrome checker does not have robust error handling for very large strings, although Python handles larger strings more gracefully than some other languages.

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- Add a sortedness check for the binary search input.
- Consider handling excessively large strings in the palindrome checker explicitly.

```
Grade: A
```

---

### Evaluation of Rust Implementation

#### **Correctness:**
- **FizzBuzz:** Correct. The `match` statement is idiomatic and handles the conditions perfectly.
- **Palindrome Checker:** Correct. The use of `flat_map` and `to_lowercase` ensures accurate filtering and case-insensitive comparison.
- **Binary Search:** Correct. The function works as expected, although the `saturating_sub` and `saturating_add` calls are unnecessary in this context because the array length is known to be non-negative.

#### **Code Quality:**
- The code adheres to Rust’s strong type system and idiomatic patterns (e.g., `match` for FizzBuzz, `flat_map` for the palindrome checker).
- Variable names and comments are clear and enhance readability.
- The palindrome checker uses byte-level comparison (`bytes[left] != bytes[right]`), which is efficient but could be more readable with `chars`.

#### **Completeness:**
- All three problems are implemented and complete.

#### **Error Handling:**
- The binary search uses `saturating_add` and `saturating_sub` unnecessarily, as integer overflows are not a concern here.
- The palindrome checker does not handle excessively large strings explicitly, but Rust’s memory safety mitigates most risks.

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- Simplify the binary search by removing unnecessary `saturating` calls.
- Use `chars` instead of `bytes` in the palindrome checker for better clarity when comparing characters.

```
Grade: A-
```

---

### Evaluation of C Implementation

#### **Correctness:**
- **FizzBuzz:** Correct. The logic is straightforward and produces the expected output.
- **Palindrome Checker:** Correct. The function filters out non-alphanumeric characters and compares characters accurately.
- **Binary Search:** Correct. The implementation works as expected.

#### **Code Quality:**
- The code follows C conventions but is less idiomatic compared to other languages (e.g., manual bounds handling in the palindrome checker).
- Comments are helpful, but the palindrome checker’s manual filtering and comparison logic could be more concise.
- The hardcoded buffer size (`char filtered[1024]`) in the palindrome checker is problematic and limits scalability.

#### **Completeness:**
- All three problems are implemented and complete.

#### **Error Handling:**
- The binary search function assumes the input array is sorted but does not explicitly check for this.
- The hardcoded buffer in the palindrome checker introduces a risk of overflow for long strings.

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- Replace the hardcoded buffer in the palindrome checker with dynamic memory allocation or a streaming approach.
- Add a sortedness check for the binary search input.
- Improve readability by simplifying verbose logic in the palindrome checker.

## TypeScript Evaluation

**1) Correctness:** The TypeScript implementations for FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search are all correct. They produce the expected output for the given test cases.

**2) Code Quality:** The code is well-structured, readable, and follows TypeScript conventions.  The use of `const` and `let` is appropriate. Type annotations are used effectively, improving readability and maintainability.  Good use of helper variables (e.g., `isMultipleOf3`, `isMultipleOf5`) in FizzBuzz.

**3) Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.

**4) Error Handling:**  While the code doesn't have explicit error handling, the functions are designed in a way that they are unlikely to throw runtime errors with expected inputs.  For example, `binarySearchTS` correctly returns -1 if the target isn't found.

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   Consider adding input validation to the functions, especially for public-facing APIs.  For example, `binarySearchTS` assumes a sorted array; validating this assumption would make the function more robust.


Grade: A

## Python Evaluation

**1) Correctness:** The Python implementations for FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search are all correct.

**2) Code Quality:** The code is generally well-structured, readable, and adheres to Python conventions.  The docstrings are helpful. The use of f-strings for printing is a good practice.  Using `isalnum()` and list comprehension/`join` in the Palindrome Checker is efficient.

**3) Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.

**4) Error Handling:** No explicit error handling is present, but the functions handle normal cases gracefully.  Binary search correctly returns -1 when the element is not found.


Grade: A

## Rust Evaluation

**1) Correctness:** The Rust implementations are correct for the given test cases.

**2) Code Quality:** The Rust code is well-written, idiomatic, and leverages Rust's features effectively. The use of `match` in FizzBuzz is a good example. The palindrome function correctly uses `flat_map` to handle combining multi-byte characters from `to_lowercase`. The use of `saturating_sub` and `saturating_add` in the binary search prevents potential underflow/overflow issues, and the special casing for `mid == 0` is a good defensive programming technique.

**3) Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.

**4) Error Handling:** The Rust code uses `saturating_*` methods for integer operations, demonstrating good error prevention. The comments explain the rationale behind the code clearly.

**Areas for Improvement:**


Grade: A+


## C Evaluation

**1) Correctness:** The C implementations for FizzBuzz, Palindrome Checker, and Binary Search are correct.

**2) Code Quality:** The code is reasonably well-structured and readable. The use of `bool` from `stdbool.h` is good. The code is functional, but there's room for improvement in terms of style and robustness.

**3) Completeness:** All three problems are implemented.

**4) Error Handling:** The palindrome checker has a fixed-size buffer for the filtered string, introducing a limit on the input size.  This should be documented or, ideally, handled more dynamically if long palindromes are expected. The binary search correctly handles edge cases where the search value isn't present in the array.   

**Areas for Improvement:**

*   **Palindrome Checker Buffer Size:**  The fixed-size buffer in `isPalindromeC` (`filtered[1024]`) is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. Use dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `malloc`) or increase the buffer size significantly and add documentation clarifying limitations. 
*   **Const Correctness:** In `binarySearchC`, declare `arr` as `const int *arr` to emphasize that it's not modified.

Grade: B+

```
Grade: B
```

**TypeScript**  
**Correctness:** All functions work as expected. FizzBuzz conditions are ordered correctly, palindrome checks via two-pointer approach, and binary search is correctly implemented.  
**Code Quality:** Clean, follows conventions. Constants (`const`) used appropriately.  
**Improvements:** None critical.

**Python**  
**Correctness:** All functions behave correctly, with FizzBuzz, palindrome (using slice reversal), and binary search passing basic tests.  
**Code Quality:** Idiomatic Python (e.g., `filtered[::-1]`). Minor note: Reversing the entire string for palindromes uses O(n) space.  
**Improvements:** Consider iterating with two pointers for palindromes to save memory.

**Rust**  
**Correctness:** FizzBuzz is correct. **Binary search has a critical flaw**: `(left + right) / 2` can overflow for large arrays; should use `left + (right - left) / 2`.  
**Palindrome Checker:** Handles Unicode characters correctly. Two-pointer approach is efficient.  
**Error Handling:** Breaks early in binary search for `mid == 0`, which is safe but unconventional.  
**Improvements:** Fix binary search integer overflow vulnerability.

**C**  
**Correctness:** **Major flaw in `isPalindromeC`**: Fixed buffer (1024) truncates long inputs, leading to incorrect results.  
**Code Quality:** Magic number 1024 is error-prone (should be a macro/constant). Binary search is correct.  
**Error Handling:** Buffer truncation in `isPalindromeC` is a critical omission. No dynamic allocation for filtered strings.  
**Improvements:** Use dynamic memory for filtered strings in `isPalindromeC`.

**Overall**  
Correctness and error handling issues in Rust (binary search) and C (palindrome buffer) lower the grade. Code quality is strong in TypeScript and Python but weaker in C. All implementations are complete. Grade reflects these disparate strengths.

**Letter Grade:** B
**Numeric Grade:** 3.0

• Code Quality: The code is well structured with clear comments and descriptive naming. It follows typical TS/JavaScript conventions.
• Completeness: All three problems are implemented.
• Error Handling: There isn’t any extra error handling (for example, checking if the input array is sorted for binary search), but for a controlled problem it’s acceptable.

Python

• Correctness: The implementations work as expected. FizzBuzz iterates over the proper range, the palindrome checker properly filters characters and compares the reversed string, and binary search uses a standard iterative method.
• Code Quality: The code is clean and uses docstrings and type hints. The style is idiomatic.
• Completeness: All three problems are present.
• Error Handling: As with many interview solutions, it assumes proper inputs. There’s no extra error checking, but that is acceptable for these examples.

Rust
────────────────────────────
• Correctness: Overall the solutions execute the intended tasks. The FizzBuzz and binary search functions work well for non‐edge-case inputs.
• Code Quality: The structure and use of match (in FizzBuzz) plus comments are clear. The palindrome function uses filtering and iterates with two pointers.
• Completeness: All three problems are implemented.
• Error Handling: There is a potential issue in the palindrome checker if the filtered string is empty. Because the code sets “right” using wrapping_sub(1) without checking for an empty slice, an empty input could lead to an out‐of‐bounds access. (Similarly, binary search assumes a nonempty array.) A guard for empty input would improve robustness.

C
────────────────────────────
• Correctness: The three functions work as intended for standard inputs. FizzBuzz, palindrome check (with a filtered copy), and binary search are implemented using typical C idioms.
• Code Quality: The code is clear and well commented. The use of a fixed buffer for the palindrome function (size 1024) is common in simple examples, though it may be a limitation.
• Completeness: All three problems are handled.
• Error Handling: There is no check against overly long strings in the palindrome checker (risking buffer overflow in extreme cases) and no explicit error handling in binary search. For the purposes of an interview exercise, these are usually acceptable but could be improved for production code.

────────────────────────────
Overall Assessment
────────────────────────────
All four language solutions demonstrate clear understanding and mostly correct logic for the three problems. The TypeScript and Python implementations are especially straightforward and robust for their intended use. The Rust version works well for non‐edge cases but could use a safeguard against empty string input. The C solution is standard but relies on a fixed buffer without validating input length.

Taking into account correctness, code quality, completeness, and minimal error handling improvements needed, the overall evaluation is very good with just a few areas for improvement.
