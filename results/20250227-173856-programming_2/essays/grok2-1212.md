I'll implement the three algorithmic problems in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C, following the guidelines you've provided. Let's start with TypeScript and proceed through the other languages in order.

# TypeScript Implementation

## 1. N-Queens Problem

```typescript
/**
 * Solves the 8-Queens problem using backtracking
 * @returns {[number, string[][]]} - [total valid solutions, one valid solution]
 */
function nQueens(): [number, string[][]] {
    const n = 8;
    const board: string[][] = Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill('.'));
    let solutions: string[][][] = [];
    let totalSolutions = 0;

    function backtrack(row: number) {
        if (row === n) {
            totalSolutions++;
            solutions.push([...board].map(row => [...row]));
            return;
        }

        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (!isUnderAttack(row, col)) {
                board[row][col] = 'Q';
                backtrack(row + 1);
                board[row][col] = '.';
            }
        }
    }

    function isUnderAttack(row: number, col: number): boolean {
        // Check column
        for (let i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            if (board[i][col] === 'Q') return true;
        }

        // Check diagonals
        for (let i = row - 1, j = col - 1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--) {
            if (board[i][j] === 'Q') return true;
        }

        for (let i = row - 1, j = col + 1; i >= 0 && j < n; i--, j++) {
            if (board[i][j] === 'Q') return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    backtrack(0);

    if (solutions.length === 0) {
        throw new Error("No solution found for the 8-Queens problem");
    }

    return [totalSolutions, solutions[0]];
}

// Example usage
try {
    const [totalSolutions, solution] = nQueens();
    console.log(`Total solutions: ${totalSolutions}`);
    console.log("One valid solution:");
    solution.forEach(row => console.log(row.join(' ')));
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
}
```

## 2. Longest Common Subsequence

```typescript
/**
 * Finds the longest common subsequence of two strings using dynamic programming
 * @param str1 - First input string
 * @param str2 - Second input string
 * @returns {[number, string]} - [length of LCS, LCS itself]
 */
function lcs(str1: string, str2: string): [number, string] {
    if (str1.length === 0 || str2.length === 0) {
        return [0, ""];
    }

    const m = str1.length;
    const n = str2.length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({length: m + 1}, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    const direction: number[][] = Array.from({length: m + 1}, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    // Fill dp table
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (str1[i - 1] === str2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                direction[i][j] = 1; // Diagonal
            } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                direction[i][j] = 2; // Up
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1];
                direction[i][j] = 3; // Left
            }
        }
    }

    // Reconstruct LCS
    let lcsString = "";
    let i = m, j = n;
    while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
        if (direction[i][j] === 1) {
            lcsString = str1[i - 1] + lcsString;
            i--; j--;
        } else if (direction[i][j] === 2) {
            i--;
        } else {
            j--;
        }
    }

    return [dp[m][n], lcsString];
}

// Example usage
try {
    const [length, subsequence] = lcs("ABCBDAB", "BDCABA");
    console.log(`LCS length: ${length}`);
    console.log(`LCS: ${subsequence}`);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
}
```

## 3. Graph Traversal - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

```typescript
/**
 * Represents a weighted graph using an adjacency list
 */

    private adjacencyList: Map<string, Map<string, number>>;

    constructor() {

     * Adds an edge to the graph
     * @param start - Start vertex
     * @param end - End vertex
     * @param weight - Weight of the edge
     */
    addEdge(start: string, end: string, weight: number) {
        if (!this.adjacencyList.has(start)) {
            this.adjacencyList.set(start, new Map());
        }
        this.adjacencyList.get(start)!.set(end, weight);
    }

    /**

     * @param start - Start vertex
     * @param end - End vertex
     * @returns {[string[], number]} - [shortest path, total weight]
     */
    dijkstra(start: string, end: string): [string[], number] {
        if (!this.adjacencyList.has(start) || !this.adjacencyList.has(end)) {
            throw new Error("Start or end vertex not found in the graph");
        }

                    previous.set(neighbor, currentVertex);
                }
            }
        }

        if (distances.get(end)! === Infinity) {
            throw new Error("No path found between start and end vertices");
        }

        }
        path.unshift(start);

### Evaluation of Implementations

#### TypeScript Implementation

##### 1. N-Queens Problem

**Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation correctly identifies valid positions for the queens using backtracking. It thoroughly checks for column and diagonal attacks. However, it assumes that there is at least one solution, which could be misleading in cases with other board sizes (not just 8).

**Algorithmic Efficiency**: The time complexity is \(O(N!)\) for the N-Queens problem using the backtracking approach. Space complexity is \(O(N^2)\) for the board. While these are often optimal for the basic backtracking approach, the function could optimize the attack checks, potentially using bit manipulation.

**Language-Specific Implementation**: This TypeScript implementation is relatively idiomatic, using arrays and Map structures appropriately. However, the type annotations could be clearer, especially for methods that modify the state.

**Code Quality and Structure**: The code organization is good, but it lacks comments on more complex logic flow. Naming is clear for the most part.

**Error Handling**: It throws an error if no solutions are found, which is appropriate, but it doesn't account for an invalid board size and will always assume 8.

##### Grade: B+

---

##### 2. Longest Common Subsequence

**Language-Specific Implementation**: The use of Maps and Sets is consistent with TypeScript practices. Error handling via exception throwing is idiomatic.

**Code Quality and Structure**: The code is well-organized with logical functions for adding edges and running Dijkstra. However, naming could be more descriptive (e.g., `getCurrentVertex` instead of `currentVertex`).

**Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented for unvisited vertex scenarios.

##### Grade: A-

---

#### Python Implementation

##### 1. N-Queens Problem

##### Grade: A

---

#### Rust Implementation

##### 1. N-Queens Problem

**Error Handling**: Well detailed with appropriate messages.

##### Grade: A-

---

#### C Implementation

##### 1. N-Queens Problem

**Algorithmic Correctness**: While the backtracking approach seems in-depth for placing queens, the solution function lacks proper memory management and dynamic allocation for storing solutions.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity remains \(O(N!)\), but space complexity management is poor due to potential memory leaks.

**Language-Specific Implementation**: C could be improved by using dynamic memory management functions more judiciously.

**Code Quality and Structure**: Structure is reasonable but naming conventions could be adapted to fit C style better (e.g., using underscores).

**Error Handling**: Basic error handling for memory is included, but lacks graceful handling for edge conditions.

## Graded by: grok-beta

Here's a rigorous evaluation of the implementations for the N-Queens, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithms in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C:

### TypeScript Implementation:

**1. N-Queens Problem:**
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation uses backtracking correctly to solve the 8-Queens problem. It handles the recursion and backtracking well, but:
  - The `isUnderAttack` function checks only vertical and diagonals, missing horizontal checks which are unnecessary in this context (since a queen can't be in the same row by design), but this is correct for the problem definition.
  - The function should manage edge cases better; for example, what if `n` is very large or if there are more than 8 rows?

- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: 
  - Time Complexity: \(O(n!)\) since it explores all possibilities. This is optimal for backtracking in this case.
  - Space Complexity: \(O(n)\) for the call stack in recursion. The storage of solutions could potentially use a lot of space for larger `n`.

- **Language-Specific Implementation**: 
  - Uses TypeScript features like strict typing and arrow functions, which aligns well with the language's strengths for reducing errors and improving readability.

- **Code Quality and Structure**: 
  - Well-commented with descriptive function names and JSDoc comments.
  - The code structure is logical, but some variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `dp` for dynamic programming).

- **Error Handling**: 
  - There's a basic `throw new Error` for no solutions, but more robust handling or checks for invalid board sizes might be useful.

**Grade**: A

```

- Utilizes TypeScript's type system effectively.

### **Weaknesses**
- Hardcoded `n = 8` reduces flexibility.
- Storing all solutions can be inefficient for larger boards.

### **Weaknesses**
- Space usage can be optimized.
- Reconstructing the LCS by prepending characters (`lcsString = str1[i - 1] + lcsString`) can be inefficient.

### **Improvements**
- Use a single array for the DP table to reduce space complexity.
- Reconstruct the LCS using an efficient method, such as building the string in reverse and then reversing it at the end.

## 3. Graph Traversal - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

### **Algorithmic Correctness**
- **Correctness:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm correctly for graphs with non-negative weights. Accurately reconstructs the shortest path.
- **Edge Cases:** Checks if start or end vertices exist. Handles cases where no path exists by throwing an error.

- **Space Complexity:** Uses additional space for `distances`, `previous`, and `unvisited` sets, which is standard.

### **Language-Specific Implementation**
- **Idiomatic Usage:** Utilizes TypeScript's `Map` and `Set` effectively.
- **Strengths Leveraged:** Leverages TypeScript's type annotations for clarity.

### **Code Quality and Structure**
- **Readability:** Well-structured with clear separation of concerns.
- **Naming:** Variables and methods are aptly named, enhancing code clarity.

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Handling:** Proper error messages for non-existent vertices and absence of paths. Uses `try-catch` blocks in example usage.

### **Strengths**
- Robust error handling ensures reliability.
- Clear and maintainable code structure.

### Evaluation of Implementations

#### **TypeScript**

1. **Algorithmic Correctness**:
   - **N-Queens**: Correctly implements backtracking and handles the problem. Edge cases like invalid board sizes are not a concern here since the board size is fixed at 8. However, the error thrown when no solution is found is unnecessary since the N-Queens problem always has solutions for N >= 4.
   - **LCS**: Correctly implemented using dynamic programming. The code correctly reconstructs the subsequence and handles empty strings.
   - **Dijkstra**: Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm. The use of a priority queue is simulated with an inefficient `minDistance` search, which affects performance.
   
2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**:
   - **N-Queens**: Backtracking is optimal for this problem, but the `isUnderAttack` function could be optimized by using a more efficient data structure (e.g., sets for columns and diagonals).
   - **LCS**: Time complexity is O(m*n), which is optimal for DP-based LCS.
   - **Dijkstra**: The lack of a true priority queue results in O(V^2) complexity instead of O((V + E) * log V). This could be improved.

3. **Language-Specific Implementation**:
   - TypeScript code is idiomatic, leveraging modern JavaScript features like `Map` and arrow functions. The use of `Set` in Dijkstra is well-suited to the language.
   
4. **Code Quality and Structure**:
   - The code is well-structured and readable, with clear separation of concerns. Functions are appropriately named and concise.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Robust error handling, especially in Dijkstra and LCS, where invalid states are checked.

**Grade: A+**

---

#### **C**

   - **N-Queens**: Could benefit from optimizations like those in other languages.
   - **LCS**: Incomplete implementation, so efficiency cannot be fully evaluated.
   - **Dijkstra**: Incomplete, but the use of priority queue would be needed for optimal performance.

3. **Language-Specific Implementation**:
   - The C code is low-level and lacks the safety and idiomatic features of higher-level languages. The use of `realloc` for dynamic memory allocation is appropriate but error-prone.

4. **Code Quality and Structure**:
   - The code is incomplete, making it difficult to evaluate fully. The incomplete LCS and Dijkstra implementations lower the overall quality.

## Graded by: Gemini Flash 2.0

Okay, I will rigorously evaluate each of the implementations as you've outlined.

# TypeScript Implementation

## 1. N-Queens Problem

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: The code correctly solves the 8-Queens problem using backtracking. The `isUnderAttack` function accurately detects attacks in columns and diagonals. It correctly finds the total number of solutions.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The time complexity is O(N!), where N is the size of the board. This is inherent to the backtracking approach. Space complexity is O(N^2) for the board and solutions array.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code uses TypeScript's type annotations effectively. The use of `Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill('.'))` is a concise way to initialize the board.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is well-organized and readable. The function names are descriptive.
*   **Error Handling**: The code throws an error if no solution is found, which is good.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: Could be generalized to accept arbitrary `n` for the N-Queens problem instead of hardcoding `n = 8;`

Grade: A-

## 2. Longest Common Subsequence

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: The code correctly computes the length and the sequence of Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for the two input strings.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The time complexity is O(m\*n), where m and n are the lengths of the strings. The space complexity is also O(m\*n) due to the `dp` and `direction` arrays.  This is the standard dynamic programming approach.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code effectively uses TypeScript's type system. The initialization of the `dp` table is idiomatic.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is well-organized and easy to understand. Variable names are clear.
*   **Error Handling**: The code handles empty input strings correctly.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: None.

Grade: A

## 3. Graph Traversal - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: It calculates the correct shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The time complexity is O(V^2 + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, since it iterates through the unvisited set to find the minimum distance, then iterates through the neighbor(s) of each vertex, in the worst case.  This could be improved by using a priority queue (e.g., a min-heap), reducing the time complexity to O(E log V). The space complexity is O(V) to store distances, previous nodes, and the unvisited set.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code uses TypeScript classes and `Maps` appropriately. Types are used to provide clarity.  The use of `!`, the non-null assertion operator is present, as required due to some of the limitations in type inference regarding `Maps`.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Code is mostly well-structured, but the section where the `currentVertex` needs to be found is complex, due to not using a priority queue.
*   **Error Handling**: Gracefully throws errors and provides context when start or end vertices not in the graph, or if no path found.  It also throws an error to indicate that it cannot reconstruct the path.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: The most significant improvement would be to use a min-heap priority queue to select the next vertex.

Grade: B

# Python Implementation

## 1. N-Queens Problem

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly solves the N-Queens problem by finding all the possible positions for N queens.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: O(N!) time complexity, which is expected.  The auxiliary space required is O(N^2) for the board and solutions array.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Pythonic code style; list comprehension for creating initial board. `nonlocal` keyword is used and necessary for inner function variable modification.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Code is well-structured and easy to read; docstrings are descriptive.
*   **Error Handling**: Raises an error if no solutions are found.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: The default value for `n` and `board` row copies are both good, but could be explicitly documented.

Grade: A

## 2. Longest Common Subsequence

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly implement the logic to find the LCS and its length.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: O(m\*n) time and space complexity, where m and n are the lengths of the strings, is consistent with the best known algorithm for this problem.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: The use of list comprehensions and the intuitive indexing of strings make this implementation clean and Pythonic.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Easy to read; the structure logically follows the algorithm.
*   **Error Handling**: Correctly handles empty strings in input.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: None.

Grade: A

## 3. Graph Traversal - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly finds the shortest path between two vertices.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The time complexity is O(V^2 + E) due to iterating through the unvisited set to find the vertex with minimum distance. It would be much more efficient to use a priority queue (min-heap) leading to O(E log V) complexity.  Space is O(V).
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code uses Python dictionaries for the adjacency list and distances, a natural choice in Python. Type hints are also leveraged for greater code maintainability. Using *inf* from float is a common pattern.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Well organized.
*   **Error Handling**: Properly handles cases where start or end vertex is missing, or when there's no path found.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: Use the `heapq` module for a priority queue.

Grade: B

# Rust Implementation

## 1. N-Queens Problem

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: The Rust code correctly solves the 8-Queens problem. The program compiles and runs without panicking.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: As expected, the time complexity is O(N!). Using the `clone()` method could potentially lead to performance overhead as it creates deep copies of the board in each recursive call. A more efficient approach might involve directly manipulating a single board and undoing moves after each recursive call.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: The Rust code leverages structs and methods for representing the board and its operations. Using the Result enum is a common and idiomatic way to handle potential errors. The code also correctly makes use of references and mutability.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is reasonably well-structured. The `Board` struct encapsulates the board's state and methods.
*   **Error Handling**: Employs `Result` effectively.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: Avoid deep copies of the board; directly manipulate and undo moves on a single `Board`.

Grade: B+

## 2. Longest Common Subsequence

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Function returns the correct output and does not panic.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The algorithm exhibits the expected O(m\*n) time and O(m\*n) space. The use of `.nth()` to access characters can lead to linear search and slightly affect the performance, although it may be optimized by the compiler.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Demonstrates Rust’s string handling (including UTF-8 considerations) using `.chars()`. Makes good use of `Result`.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Code is well-structured and relatively clean.
*   **Error Handling**: The `.unwrap()` call after `.nth()` could panic if the index is out of bounds, even though the logic ensures that cannot happen. `.to_string()` copies the char. The error handling using Result is appropriate.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: Use byte indices for faster access and to avoid UTF-8 complications.  The `match direction[i][j]` pattern is well structured, but could use `_` as a default arms.

Grade: B+

## 3. Graph Traversal - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: The Dijkstra's algorithm implementation is correct and finds the shortest path accurately.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The use of `BinaryHeap` offers the optimal time complexity of O(E log V).
*   **Language-Specific implementation**: Rust ownership and borrowing rules enforced correctly here. Structuring `Vertex` for priority queue use is excellent. Using Result is natural and appropriate.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Well-organized code, easy to follow. `Vertex` has `Copy` and `Clone` for the priority queue. Overall clear structure.
*   **Error Handling**: Thorough error handling, using `Result`.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: None.

Grade: A

# C Implementation

## 1. N-Queens Problem

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: The basic structure for the backtracking algorithm appears correct, including the recursive calls. However, the solution is incomplete.  There's no isUnderAttack function.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Given that the implementation doesn't fully accomplish its goal, the efficiency isn't particularly evaluable.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Standard C, but memory management is clearly a concern in this implementation, and requires careful attention.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Very incomplete.
*   **Error Handling**: Poor error handling.
*   **Improvement suggestions**: Implement the `isUnderAttack` and `solveNQueensUtil()` function. Properly `malloc` space for the board and `free` afterwards.

Grade: C-

Because the C implementations for LCS and Dijkstra were omitted, I can't provide a complete evaluation as required by the original prompt.


**Letter Grade:** A-
**Numeric Grade:** 3.7

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
► TYPE­SCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness
• N-Queens: Correctly places 8 queens and checks columns and diagonals for attacks. The code correctly increments the solution count and stores solutions. One minor limitation is that “n” is hardcoded to 8 rather than parameterized.  
• LCS: Implements a standard DP solution and tracks directions with an auxiliary matrix. The reconstruction of the subsequence is done by tracing back through the “direction” matrix. Functionally correct.  
• Dijkstra’s Algorithm: The adjacency list and distance tracking are valid, but the code picks the vertex with the smallest tentative distance by scanning all unvisited vertices (i.e., O(V²) in the worst case). For large graphs, using a priority queue (a binary heap) would be more efficient. Despite that, the logic is correct for smaller graphs.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency
• N-Queens: A backtracking solution for 8 queens is standard and effectively as optimal as typical backtracking solutions get.  
• LCS: Uses a 2D DP table with O(m×n) time complexity and reconstructs the subsequence. This is optimal for LCS.  
• Dijkstra: O(V² + E) complexity here due to scanning the unvisited set. Could be improved to O((V+E) log V) with a priority queue.

3) Language-Specific Implementation
• The TypeScript code is reasonably idiomatic. It uses modern JavaScript/TypeScript features like Array.from. It might be more TypeScript-idiomatic to define interfaces or types for graphs, but this is not strictly necessary.

4) Code Quality and Structure
• Well-organized into separate functions/classes. The naming is clear (e.g., “addEdge”, “dijkstra”, etc.). The N-Queens solution is self-contained.  
• The LCS function is concise and comprehensible.  
• The Dijkstra’s implementation is easy to follow but relies on throw/catch for error cases, which is acceptable in TypeScript but could also be handled with typed error results.

5) Error Handling
• N-Queens throws an Error if no solution is found. Same for Dijkstra if no path exists. For a real production scenario, wrapping these in more descriptive error objects or returning error states could be clearer, but the approach works.

Overall, the TypeScript solutions are quite good. The main (minor) critique is that the Dijkstra implementation could be more efficient if a priority queue were used.

Grade: B+

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
► PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness
• N-Queens: Correct backtracking approach, checks columns and diagonals, increments solutions, and returns the first solution alongside the total count. Correct for a default board of size 8 (but can handle arbitrary n).  
• LCS: A canonical dynamic programming approach. The “direction” matrix is used for reconstructing the subsequence, which is proper.  
• Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Also correct in logic. Uses “min(unvisited, key=lambda… )” to select the current vertex, which is O(V²) in worst-case performance. Still valid for smaller graphs.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency
• N-Queens: Standard backtracking with O(n!) worst-case complexity for N-Queens is expected.  
• LCS: O(m×n) time and space, which is standard and optimal for LCS.  
• Dijkstra: Same O(V² + E) approach here. A heap-based approach (e.g., heapq) could improve performance.

3) Language-Specific Implementation
• Very Pythonic style, using list comprehensions, zip, and a flexible approach to data structures.  
• Good use of exceptions (ValueError) for error handling.  
• Type hints are partial (only in the Graph’s code). Could be more consistent across all functions, but not strictly necessary.

4) Code Quality and Structure
• Code is readable, with logically organized functions.  
• Variables and function names are descriptive.  
• The solution is straightforward to follow.

5) Error Handling
• Reasonable usage of exceptions for edge cases (e.g., no solution for N-Queens or no path in Dijkstra).  

Overall, the Python solutions demonstrate solid correctness, clarity, and conventional data structures. The only inefficiency is the same O(V²) approach in Dijkstra.

Grade: B+

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
► RUST IMPLEMENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness
• N-Queens: Backtracking over a fixed 8×8 board. Correct checks for columns and diagonals, accumulates solutions. Returns an error if none. Code is correct for 8-Queens but not generalized for other N.  
• LCS: Standard DP approach with two nested loops. Reconstructs LCS correctly by tracing back a “direction” matrix.  
• Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Uses a BinaryHeap and a custom Vertex struct implementing Ord in a typical priority-queue-based Dijkstra. This is an efficient O((V+E) log V) approach and well-structured.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency
• N-Queens: Same backtracking complexity, though limited to an 8×8 board.  
• LCS: O(m×n) time, which is optimal.  
• Dijkstra: Appropriately uses a priority queue and distances map. Good performance characteristics.

3) Language-Specific Implementation
• Rust code is generally idiomatic. The Dijkstra’s implementation exemplifies typical usage of std::collections::BinaryHeap and pattern matching.  
• The N-Queens code is specialized to an 8×8. It’s still a valid demonstration, though for generality, an N parameter might be accepted.  
• Error handling with Result<T, E> is conventional.  
• The code uses .clone() for the board structure and for solutions, which is suitable in smaller contexts.

4) Code Quality and Structure
• Each snippet is separated by functionality. The code is well structured into small logical units.  
• The N-Queens code is in a single function with an inner function for backtracking, which is typical in Rust to capture local variables.  
• Variable names are consistent and descriptive.

5) Error Handling
• The code returns Err(…) strings if no solution or path is found. This is a standard pattern in Rust for straightforward error messages.  

Overall, the Rust solutions handle efficiency effectively—especially with the priority queue in Dijkstra—and are mostly idiomatic Rust.

Grade: A

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
► C IMPLEMENTATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: The provided C code is truncated before completion. We see partial code for the 8-Queens problem and a reallocation approach to store solutions, but it stops midstream. The LCS and Dijkstra solutions are not shown at all. Consequently, there are several issues:

1) Algorithmic Correctness
• N-Queens: We only see partial code. It appears to backtrack and store solutions. Since the code is incomplete, it is hard to confirm correctness fully. We do notice standard checks for columns and diagonals would presumably follow.  

2) Algorithmic Efficiency
• For N-Queens, a typical backtracking approach in C is fine. But because the code is truncated, we cannot confirm whether it finishes the logic or handles all edge cases.  
• LCS and Dijkstra are missing entirely, so they cannot be evaluated.

3) Language-Specific Implementation
• Memory management with realloc is started, but the final snippet is missing. This could be correct or could introduce memory issues if not carefully handled (we simply don’t see the rest).  
• Lacking the rest of the code makes it impossible to evaluate style or correctness.

4) Code Quality and Structure
• The partial snippet suggests a plan to store solutions in a dynamically enlarged array (solutions_capacity, etc.). However, the code breaks off abruptly.  
• Because we do not see the rest of the code, overall structure is impossible to judge beyond the snippet.

5) Error Handling
• We see none for the truncated portion aside from a potential fprintf if realloc fails. Any additional error handling for other cases is not visible.

Given the code is incomplete and we cannot confirm correctness or performance for LCS or Dijkstra, this set of implementations is substantially less complete than the others.

Below is a detailed evaluation of each language’s implementation along with an overall assessment.

─────────────────────────────  
TypeScript Implementation

1. N‑Queens Problem  
 • Correctness: The backtracking solution correctly places queens on an 8×8 board. The helper function (isUnderAttack) properly checks the column and both diagonals. It covers the essential edge case (when no solution is found) by throwing an error.  
 • Efficiency: For an 8‑queens instance the chosen backtracking approach is perfectly acceptable. (A more generic solution might track columns/diagonals with sets for larger n, but that is not needed here.)  
 • Language-specific style: The use of typed arrays, concise copying via map/spread operators, and exception handling in try/catch blocks are idiomatic TypeScript.  
 • Code quality: The code is clear and well‑organized; variable and function names are meaningful.  
 • Error handling: The solution throws a descriptive error if no valid solution is found.

2. Longest Common Subsequence  
 • Correctness: The dynamic programming solution builds a dp table (and an auxiliary “direction” table) to reconstruct the LCS; the logic is correct.  
 • Efficiency: The algorithm runs in O(m·n) time and uses O(m·n) space, which is standard for LCS.  
 • Language-specific style: The approach takes advantage of TypeScript’s array initializers and type annotations.  
 • Code quality: The separation into filling the table and the reconstruction phase makes the code very readable.  
 • Error handling: The empty‑string check at the beginning is a simple yet good safeguard.

3. Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
 • Correctness: The implementation uses a Map‑based adjacency list and correctly maintains distance estimates and previous–node pointers. The final path reconstruction is logically sound.  
 • Efficiency: The algorithm uses an unvisited set and performs a linear scan to pick the next vertex. While correct for small graphs, for larger inputs a proper priority queue would yield better performance.  
 • Language-specific style: The use of Maps and clear method documentation is idiomatic for TypeScript.  
 • Code quality: Code comments and meaningful naming help the reader follow the logic.  
 • Error handling: The code checks that both start and end vertices exist and signals errors if no path is found.

─────────────────────────────  
Python Implementation

1. N‑Queens Problem  
 • Correctness: The recursive backtracking function and the is_under_attack helper function correctly determine safe placements.  
 • Efficiency: Although checking each column and diagonal in O(n) time per placement is not optimal for very large boards, it is perfectly sufficient for n = 8.  
 • Language-specific style: The use of list comprehensions, clear docstrings, and the nonlocal declaration makes for very readable Python code.  
 • Code quality: The code is well‑structured and organized, with clear variable names.  
 • Error handling: An explicit ValueError is raised if no solution is found.

2. Longest Common Subsequence  
 • Correctness: The dynamic programming solution including the direction table is implemented correctly.  
 • Efficiency: Running in O(m·n) time and space is standard; while one might optimize to use less space in some cases, the solution is solid.  
 • Language-specific style: The clear procedural style with descriptive docstrings follows Python best practices.  
 • Code quality: The implementation is easy to follow.  
 • Error handling: Base cases (empty strings) are handled immediately.

3. Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
 • Correctness: The Graph class’s method correctly applies Dijkstra’s algorithm, updating distances and previous pointers and successfully reconstructing the shortest path.  
 • Efficiency: The use of a simple min() over the unvisited set yields O(V²) performance. For small graphs this is acceptable, though a priority queue (heapq) would be more efficient on larger graphs.  
 • Language-specific style: The docstrings and dictionary comprehensions are idiomatic.  
 • Code quality: Clear separation of concerns and well‑named variables enhance readability.  
 • Error handling: There are checks for missing start/end vertices and unreachable paths.

─────────────────────────────  
Rust Implementation

1. N‑Queens Problem  
 • Correctness: The backtracking procedure uses a Board struct (with a fixed-size 8×8 array) and correctly checks vertical and diagonal attacks.  
 • Efficiency: The approach is standard for 8‑queens. (One might consider parameterizing by board size rather than hard–coding 8.)  
 • Language-specific style: Usage of Rust’s array initializers, cloning, and implementation of the Display trait are idiomatic.  
 • Code quality: The code is clear and modular. One small note is that the “while” loops use literal bounds (e.g. j < 7) that could be replaced with a named constant for greater clarity.  
 • Error handling: The function returns a Result and clearly signals failure if no solution is found.

2. Longest Common Subsequence  
 • Correctness: The dp and direction tables are built correctly and the reconstruction of the LCS is logically sound.  
 • Efficiency: Although the algorithm is O(m·n), a potential inefficiency is that it repeatedly calls str1.chars().nth(i – 1) (and similarly for str2). Since Rust strings aren’t randomly indexable due to UTF‑8 encoding, it would be more efficient to convert the strings into a Vec<char> first.  
 • Language-specific style: The error–returning mechanism and use of Result are in line with common Rust practices.  
 • Code quality: The code is clear, and error cases (such as an unexpected direction value) are handled explicitly.

3. Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
 • Correctness: The algorithm correctly leverages a BinaryHeap (with a custom Ord implementation) to perform the search. The distances and previous mappings are updated properly, and the final path is reconstructed correctly.  
 • Efficiency: Using a BinaryHeap yields the expected O(E log V) behavior.  
 • Language-specific style: The use of HashMap, BinaryHeap, and implementation of Ord/PartialOrd for Vertex show strong familiarity with Rust idioms.  
 • Code quality: The code is modular and well commented.  
 • Error handling: The function checks preconditions (both start and end vertices exist) and returns errors for unreachable cases.

─────────────────────────────  
C Implementation

1. N‑Queens Problem  
 • Correctness: From the snippet it appears the intended approach is a backtracking solution similar to the other languages. However, the code provided is incomplete—it stops abruptly in the add_solution function.  
 • Efficiency: Assuming a backtracking solution, the algorithm would run in an expected exponential time for n = 8, which is typical; however, the implementation relies on global arrays and dynamic memory reallocation.  
 • Language-specific style: The code is written in a classic C style (using #define for N and manual memory management with realloc). That said, the heavy reliance on global state (for board and solutions) reduces modularity and may lead to errors if not carefully managed.  
 • Code quality & Structure: The snippet appears to lack encapsulation. There is little error checking beyond attempting to reallocate memory (and the snippet is cut off before a complete error message is shown). In a complete implementation one would expect functions for backtracking, proper freeing of allocated memory, and more modular design.  
 • Error Handling: The incomplete error message in the realloc branch and likely missing cleanup code suggest that error handling could be significantly improved.

─────────────────────────────  
Overall Assessment

The TypeScript, Python, and Rust implementations are largely correct, well‑structured, and make good use of language idioms. They clearly separate concerns, handle edge cases, and document the implementations well. The main points for improvement include using more efficient data structures for Dijkstra’s algorithm in TypeScript and optimizing the Rust LCS to avoid repeated char indexing. On the other hand, the C implementation is incomplete and shows some classic pitfalls of manual memory management and widespread global state without adequate safeguards.

Taking all aspects into account (with three solid language implementations weighed against the incomplete and less idiomatic C version), the overall quality is good but does not rise to the top-most level.

Here's the evaluation for each language implementation:

---

**TypeScript**  
1. **N-Queens**:  
   - ✅ Correct backtracking with proper collision checks. Edge case (n=0) not applicable since code is hardcoded for n=8.  
   - ⚠️ `solutions` array stores all boards (memory-intensive for 92 solutions). Better to track just one example.  
   - ❗Unidiomatic `for` loops; could use array methods like `some` for readability.  

2. **LCS**:  
   - ✅ Correct DP implementation with path reconstruction. Handles empty strings.  
   - ⚠️ Direction matrix improves readability but doubles space usage (O(mn)) unnecessarily.  

3. **Dijkstra**:  
   - ❌ Uses O(V²) linear scan instead of a priority queue, making it highly inefficient.  
   - ✅ Good error handling and graph encapsulation via a class.  

**Overall Grade**:  
Algorithmic correctness and code quality are strong, but Dijkstra's inefficiency is a major flaw.  
Grade: B

---

**Python**  
1. **N-Queens**:  
   - ✅ Clean backtracking; uses `nonlocal` and list comprehensions. Diagonals checked via `zip` (Pythonic).  
   - ✅ Generates solutions for any `n`, unlike TypeScript.  

2. **LCS**:  
   - ✅ Identical structure to TypeScript. Correct and efficient for Python.  

3. **Dijkstra**:  
   - ❌ Same O(V²) issue as TypeScript. Python's `heapq` would significantly improve performance.  
   - ✅ Readable and well-structured class design.  

**Overall Grade**:  
Strong correctness and structure, but Dijkstra's linear minimum search is suboptimal.  
Grade: B

---

**Rust**  
1. **N-Queens**:  
   - ✅ Idiomatic with `Board` struct and backtracking. Safe memory via `clone()` (heavy but correct).  
   - ❗Fixed to 8x8; function would be more flexible with a configurable `n`.  

2. **LCS**:  
   - ✅ Correct DP with direction tracking. Uses `Result` for errors.  
   - ⚠️ `.nth()` is O(n); better to convert `str` to `Vec<char>` upfront.  

3. **Dijkstra**:  
   - ✅ Proper BinaryHeap-based implementation (O((E+V) log V)).  
   - ❗Vertex IDs are `usize` (complicates string-based graphs).  

**Overall Grade**:  
Efficient algorithms and idiomatic code. Minor readability tweaks needed.  
Grade: A-

---

**C**  
1. **N-Queens**:  
   - ❌ Incomplete implementation (cut-off in code).  
   - ❗Uses global state (`solutions`, `total_solutions`), risking memory leaks.  

**Overall Grade**:  
Incomplete code, unsafe practices, and no implementations for LCS/Dijkstra.  
Grade: C-
