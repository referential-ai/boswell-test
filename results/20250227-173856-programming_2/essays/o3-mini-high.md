/*
 * TypeScript Implementation for:

Notes:
──────────────────────────────
• Each implementation includes error checking (e.g. memory allocation in C, verifying vertex existence in TypeScript/Dijkstra).
• The N-Queens solution uses backtracking and records both the full count and one valid board configuration.
• The LCS implementations reconstruct one valid longest common subsequence from the DP table.
• Dijkstra’s algorithm is implemented using a priority queue in TypeScript and Rust (for efficiency) and via an O(V²) loop in C for simplicity.
• Adjust or extend as needed for additional error checking or interface improvements.

Happy coding!

### TypeScript Implementation (main.ts)

#### 1) Algorithmic Correctness
- **N-Queens Problem**: Correctly implements the backtracking algorithm. It calculates the number of valid solutions and finds one valid configuration. No edge cases appear to be missed.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: The implementation is correct and returns both the length and one valid subsequence without missing any edge cases (such as empty strings).
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: The implementation is mostly correct, handles graphs that aren't connected, and raises appropriate error messages. However, it should check for unvisited nodes before processing, and an early exit could potentially handle cases where the start node is the end node (which is currently skipped).

#### 2) Algorithmic Efficiency
- **N-Queens Problem**: Time complexity is O(N!). This is standard for this problem.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Time complexity is O(m*n), which is optimal for a DP solution.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Uses a binary min-heap, achieving O(E log V), which is efficient. However, it could improve readability by utilizing a priority queue directly.

#### 3) Language-Specific Implementation
- The Typescript implementation is idiomatic, utilizing `Map`, `Array.from`, and `console.log` effectively for clarity and structure.
- An interface is appropriately used for edges, which is idiomatic in TypeScript.

#### 4) Code Quality and Structure
- The code is well-organized with good variable and function naming conventions. Comments are clear and explain the intent of the code concisely.

#### 5) Error Handling
- Handles errors related to Dijkstra's start node not being present in the graph and if no path is found. However, it could improve by handling cases where the start is the same as the end more gracefully.

Overall, the code is solid but could benefit from minor tweaks in error handling within Dijkstra's Algorithm.

```
Grade: A-
```

---

### Python Implementation (main.py)

#### 1) Algorithmic Correctness
- **N-Queens**: Correct implementation with valid outputs and well-handled edge cases.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Correctly solves the problem. Outputs the correct length and sequence with edge cases duly handled.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Correctly calculates the shortest path. It should improve error handling for when the start and end are the same.

#### 2) Algorithmic Efficiency
- All algorithms present optimal complexities: N-Queens is O(N!), LCS is O(m*n), and Dijkstra's is O(E log V).

#### 3) Language-Specific Implementation
- The use of lists, dictionaries, and tuples is idiomatic in Python. The use of comprehensions enhances readability.

#### 4) Code Quality and Structure
- The implementation is organized with clear variable names and well-structured logic. Documentation through comments is satisfactory.

#### 5) Error Handling
- The code captures graphs with no routes effectively and returns `None` if no path exists. However, checking for trivial cases like start equals end isn’t implemented.

The Python implementation is nearly comprehensive but could be slightly improved in error handling.

```
Grade: A-
```

---

### Rust Implementation (main.rs)

#### 1) Algorithmic Correctness
- **N-Queens**: The implementation is correct and efficiently finds the count and one valid configuration.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Correctly implements the LCS algorithm; checks for conditions adequately.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Functions well, but early exit handling could be improved when the start and end coincides.

#### 2) Algorithmic Efficiency
- The complexities are well within bounds for efficiency: O(N!) for N-Queens, O(m*n) for LCS, O(E log V) for Dijkstra's with binary heap.

#### 3) Language-Specific Implementation
- Uses Rust idioms effectively like pattern matching, ownership, and borrowing. The use of vectors and iterators is appropriate.

#### 4) Code Quality and Structure
- The code is clean, with meaningful variable names and functions. However, Rust’s tendency for explicitness can be better exploited in places like function signatures.

#### 5) Error Handling
- The Dijkstra implementation allows for commands to be run when incorrect indices are provided, which is a strong error handling strategy.

The Rust implementation is very good overall, with slight improvements needed for edge cases handling.

```
Grade: A
```

---

### C Implementation (main.c)

#### 1) Algorithmic Correctness
- **N-Queens Problem**: Provides correct output and successfully handles edge cases.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Correctly implemented with LCS and length returned, including necessary checks.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Functions well, but the O(V²) approach limits efficiency for larger graphs. The handling of non-connected graphs could be improved.

#### 2) Algorithmic Efficiency
- The N-Queens run time is expected (O(N!)), LCS remains O(m*n), while Dijkstra’s algorithm is relatively inefficient due to the O(V²) approach, which could be replaced with a priority queue for better performance.

#### 3) Language-Specific Implementation
- C implementation leverages pointers and dynamic memory, which is good; however, it would benefit from more extensive comments explaining pointers and memory management, as these are tricky for new programmers.

#### 4) Code Quality and Structure
- While organized, lacks consistency in naming conventions and thorough inline documentation. The code could benefit from a more modular approach.

#### 5) Error Handling
- It handles allocation failures but could improve error checking before using indices that may not exist, particularly in Dijkstra’s algorithm.

The C implementation is functional but has noticeable weaknesses in efficiency and code conventions.

Let me provide a detailed evaluation of each implementation:

**TypeScript Implementation**

1) **Algorithmic Correctness**
   - **N-Queens Problem**: Correct. Efficiently uses backtracking to find all solutions and records one solution accurately.
   - **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Correct implementation using dynamic programming. Handles the construction of one subsequence properly.
   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Correct, though there's a minor issue where if a path from `start` to `end` doesn't exist, it continues looping unnecessarily; however, this doesn't affect correctness.

2) **Algorithmic Efficiency**
   - **N-Queens**: O(N!) time complexity which is optimal for backtracking in this problem. Space complexity is O(N) for the recursion stack and the board.
   - **LCS**: O(MN) time and space complexity where M and N are string lengths, which is optimal for dynamic programming.
   - **Dijkstra**: Uses a min-heap for V log E where V is vertices and E is edges. Could optimize further by using binary search for extracting min from the heap, but current implementation is correct.

3) **Language-Specific Implementation**
   - Leverages TypeScript's type system for interfaces and generics in PriorityQueue which is very idiomatic.
   - However, TypeScript's array methods could have been leveraged more (like using `Array.every()` in `isSafe`).

4) **Code Quality and Structure**
   - The code is well-organized with clear comments. However, naming could be more descriptive in places like `board[row] = col` could be `boardPositions[row] = queenColumn`.

5) **Error Handling**
   - Checks for start vertex's existence in Dijkstra. However, more checks could be added, especially in edge cases like invalid input strings for LCS.

**Critique:**
- Naming could improve for readability. More functional programming paradigms could enhance the `isSafe` function for N-Queens.
- In Dijkstra, handling of unknown paths could terminate earlier when it's apparent no path exists.
- TypeScript's strengths in type-checking for runtime errors are well-used here.

**Grades:**
```
Grade: A-
```

**Python Implementation**

1) **Algorithmic Correctness**
   - **N-Queens:** Correct with backtracking logic.
   - **LCS:** Correct with dynamic programming.

2) **Algorithmic Efficiency**
   - **N-Queens:** Same as TypeScript, optimal for backtracking.
   - **LCS:** Optimal as in TypeScript.

3) **Language-Specific Implementation**
   - Makes good use of Python's list comprehension and functional programming paradigms.
   - Could better utilize Python's dynamic typing to manage memory more efficiently in `solve_nqueens` (e.g., passing an array by reference).

4) **Code Quality and Structure**
   - Well-commented and structured. Some function names are not very descriptive, like `solve`.

5) **Error Handling**
   - A basic error check for Dijkstra which could be enhanced (like checking for empty graph or invalid vertices).

**Critique:**
- Code uses Python idioms well, but some missed optimizations in function naming and better usage of list comprehensions.
- Error checks could be made more robust, particularly around input validation.

**Grades:**
```
Grade: B+

## Graded by: Claude-3-Opus

Thank you for the detailed instructions and code samples across multiple languages. I will review and evaluate each implementation based on the criteria you specified. Here is my analysis:

TypeScript Implementation:
1) Algorithmic Correctness: The implementations correctly solve all three problems. The N-Queens solution uses backtracking effectively, the LCS solution applies dynamic programming correctly, and Dijkstra's algorithm properly finds the shortest path.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency: The time and space complexity for each problem is optimal. The N-Queens has exponential time complexity but avoids unnecessary space usage. The LCS solution has O(mn) time and space complexity. Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue has O((V+E)logV) time complexity.

3) Language-Specific Implementation: The code leverages TypeScript's static typing well to catch potential errors. The use of interfaces and generics for the Priority Queue is effective. However, some minor improvements like using `const` more often and leveraging type inference could make the code even more idiomatic.

4) Code Quality and Structure: The code is well-organized with clear separation of concerns. Function and variable names are descriptive. Adding a few more comments explaining the overall approach for each algorithm could enhance readability.

5) Error Handling: Error cases are handled, such as checking for invalid vertices in Dijkstra's algorithm and gracefully handling the case when no path is found. 

Grade: A-

Python Implementation: 
1) Algorithmic Correctness: All three implementations are correct and handle the problems as expected. The logic for backtracking, dynamic programming, and Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented accurately.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency: The efficiency is excellent for all problems. Using a heap for the priority queue optimizes Dijkstra. The time and space complexity match the optimal solutions.

3) Language-Specific Implementation: The code is highly Pythonic, using list comprehensions, generator expressions, and `enumerate` effectively. The use of `nonlocal` for the backtracking solution is clever. Leveraging `float('inf')` for representing infinity is idiomatic.

4) Code Quality and Structure: The code is clean, concise and easy to follow. Function docstrings provide clear explanations. Descriptive variable names aid understandability.

5) Error Handling: The implementations handle potential issues like no path in Dijkstra's gracefully by returning `None`. For improvements, adding more explicit error checking for invalid inputs would be beneficial.

Grade: A 

Rust Implementation:
1) Algorithmic Correctness: The Rust implementations are correct and solve the problems effectively. The logic for N-Queens, LCS, and Dijkstra's algorithm is sound.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency: The efficiency is optimal for all three problems. Using a binary heap for Dijkstra's priority queue is a good choice. The time and space complexity are as expected.

3) Language-Specific Implementation: The code showcases effective use of Rust's ownership system, borrowing rules, and data structures. The `BinaryHeap` with `Reverse` for max-heap is idiomatic. Using `Vec` and `Option` is appropriate. The code also handles edge cases like integer overflow with `saturating_add`.

4) Code Quality and Structure: The structure is clear with separate functions for each problem. Using descriptive variable names and comments explaining key steps enhances readability. The code is concise yet understandable.

5) Error Handling: The implementation checks for error cases like invalid vertex indices in Dijkstra's and handles them by returning `None`. The use of `Option` aligns with Rust's error handling idioms.

Grade: A

C Implementation:
1) Algorithmic Correctness: The C implementations are mostly correct. The N-Queens backtracking, LCS dynamic programming, and Dijkstra's algorithm are implemented accurately. However, there's a small bug in the LCS reconstruction logic where it accesses `s1[i-1]` and `s2[j-1]` instead of `s1[i]` and `s2[j]` when comparing characters.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency: The efficiency is optimal for N-Queens and LCS. For Dijkstra's, using an O(V^2) loop instead of a priority queue is less efficient but still acceptable for simplicity. 

3) Language-Specific Implementation: The code uses C's features effectively, such as structs for graph edges and 2D arrays for the dp table. However, there are potential issues like memory leaks if `malloc` fails. Using `calloc` or checking `malloc`'s return value would be safer.

4) Code Quality and Structure: The code is structured with clear separation of problems. The use of `#define` constants and typedef for `Edge` improves readability. However, the C implementation could benefit from more comments explaining the overall approach and key steps.

5) Error Handling: The code checks for memory allocation failures in `longest_common_subsequence` and `add_edge` and exits gracefully. It also handles the case when no path is found in Dijkstra's. However, more comprehensive error checking, such as for invalid inputs, would enhance robustness.

Grade: B

In summary, the TypeScript, Python, and Rust implementations are excellent, with optimal efficiency, idiomatic language usage, and good code quality. The C implementation is mostly correct but has a small bug and could benefit from improved error handling and comments. The overall code demonstrates a strong understanding of the algorithms and effective problem-solving skills.

### TypeScript Implementation

#### 1) N-Queens Problem

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
The implementation correctly employs a backtracking approach to solve the N-Queens problem. It accurately counts all possible solutions and records the first valid solution found. The `isSafe` function effectively checks for column and diagonal conflicts, ensuring that queens are placed without attacking each other. Edge cases, such as different board sizes, are inherently handled by the recursive backtracking mechanism.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
The backtracking algorithm used has a time complexity of O(N!), which is standard for the N-Queens problem. While this is not optimal for very large `n`, it is appropriate for the typical use case (e.g., 8-Queens). The space complexity is O(N) due to the recursion stack and board representation, which is efficient for this problem size.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
The implementation leverages TypeScript's type system effectively. Using arrays with explicit types enhances code safety and readability. The use of closures (`isSafe` and `backtrack` functions) is idiomatic in TypeScript for encapsulating helper functions.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
The code is well-organized, with clear separation of concerns among functions. Variable and function names are descriptive (`solveNQueens`, `isSafe`, `backtrack`), enhancing readability. The use of comments aids in understanding the approach.

**Error Handling**:  
The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. While typical usage ensures valid input, additional input validation (e.g., checking if `n` is a positive integer) could make the implementation more robust.

#### 2) Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
The dynamic programming approach accurately computes the length of the LCS and reconstructs one valid subsequence. The DP table is correctly filled based on standard LCS recurrence relations, and the backtracking process properly retrieves the subsequence.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
The implementation has a time and space complexity of O(mn), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings. This is optimal for the LCS problem. Space usage could be optimized to O(min(m, n)) if only the length is required, but since the subsequence is reconstructed, the current approach is justified.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Utilizes TypeScript arrays effectively for the DP table and sequence reconstruction. The use of `Array.from` for initializing the 2D array is idiomatic. String manipulation leverages TypeScript's built-in methods.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Functions are modular and purpose-driven (`longestCommonSubsequence`). Variable names like `dp`, `sequenceChars`, and indices (`i`, `j`) are standard and clear. The code is easy to follow with appropriate comments.

**Error Handling**:  
Assumes that input strings are non-null and properly formatted. Additional checks could be incorporated to handle null or undefined inputs gracefully.

#### 3) Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
The implementation correctly follows Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue (min-heap) to determine the shortest path. It accurately updates distances and predecessors, ensuring the correct path and total distance are returned. Edge cases, such as disconnected graphs or non-existent paths, are handled gracefully by returning `null` and logging appropriate error messages.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
Utilizes a binary min-heap for the priority queue, achieving a time complexity of O((E + V) log V), which is efficient for sparse graphs. The space complexity is appropriate, utilizing additional maps for distances and predecessors.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
The implementation makes good use of TypeScript's `Map` and `interface` constructs for graph representation and edge definitions. The `PriorityQueue` class is well-implemented, leveraging TypeScript's type system. The use of classes and private methods (`bubbleUp`, `sinkDown`) aligns with object-oriented principles in TypeScript.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Code is modular, with clear separation between graph definitions, the priority queue, and the Dijkstra function. Variable names are descriptive (`distances`, `previous`, `currentVertex`). Comments provide clarity on the purpose of code sections.

**Error Handling**:

### Python Implementation

#### 1) N-Queens Problem

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
The Python implementation accurately solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking approach. It correctly counts all valid solutions and captures the first found solution. The `is_safe` logic within the `backtrack` function effectively checks for column and diagonal conflicts, ensuring queens do not attack each other. Edge cases, such as varying board sizes, are inherently managed by the recursive backtracking.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
The backtracking algorithm exhibits a time complexity of O(N!), which is standard for the N-Queens problem and suitable for typical values of `n` (e.g., 8). The space complexity is O(N) due to the recursion stack and the board representation, which is efficient for this use case.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Uses Python's list comprehensions and dynamic typing effectively. The implementation leverages Python's simplicity and readability, making the code concise and easy to understand. The use of `nonlocal` within the nested `backtrack` function is appropriate for modifying outer scope variables.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Functions are well-defined and modular (`solve_nqueens`). Variable names such as `count`, `first_solution`, and `board` are descriptive. The code is clean, with clear indentation and spacing, adhering to Python's PEP 8 standards. Comments enhance understanding without cluttering the code.

**Error Handling**:  
Assumes that `n` is a positive integer. While the typical use case ensures valid input, additional checks (e.g., verifying that `n` is an integer and greater than zero) could improve robustness.

#### 2) Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
The dynamic programming approach correctly calculates the length of the LCS and reconstructs one valid subsequence. The DP table is filled based on standard LCS logic, and the backtracking mechanism accurately retrieves the subsequence.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
Achieves a time and space complexity of O(mn), which is optimal for the LCS problem. While space can be optimized to O(min(m, n)) when only the length is needed, the current implementation is justified as it reconstructs the subsequence.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Utilizes Python's dynamic lists and slicing effectively. The use of list comprehensions for initializing the DP table enhances readability. String manipulation leverages Python's powerful string methods.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
The code is well-organized, with clear function definitions and descriptive variable names (`dp`, `sequence`). The use of `map` and `join` for string reconstruction is idiomatic in Python. Comments provide necessary explanations without overwhelming the reader.

**Error Handling**:  
Assumes that input strings are valid and non-null. Incorporating checks for empty strings or invalid inputs could enhance the implementation's robustness.

#### 3) Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
Implements Dijkstra's algorithm accurately using Python's `heapq` module for the priority queue, ensuring that the shortest path is correctly determined. It updates distances and predecessors appropriately and handles cases where no path exists by returning `None`.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
Utilizes a min-heap (`heapq`) to achieve a time complexity of O((E + V) log V), which is efficient for sparse graphs. The space complexity is appropriate, using additional dictionaries to store distances and predecessors.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Makes effective use of Python's built-in data structures (`dict`, `heapq`). The use of tuples within the heap for priority queuing is idiomatic. The code is concise and leverages Python's dynamic typing and high-level constructs.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
The implementation is modular with clear function definitions (`dijkstra`). Variable names like `dist`, `prev`, and `heap` are descriptive. The code is clean, readable, and adheres to Pythonic conventions. Comments assist in understanding the flow without being excessive.

**Error Handling**:  
Handles scenarios where the start vertex is not present or no path exists gracefully by returning `None` and printing messages. Ensures that invalid inputs do not cause unexpected crashes.

#### Overall Assessment

The Python implementation is clear, efficient, and leverages Python's strengths effectively. It maintains high readability and code quality, making it accessible and maintainable. While additional input validations could enhance robustness, the implementations are functionally sound and idiomatic.

### Rust Implementation

#### 1) N-Queens Problem

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
The Rust implementation correctly solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking approach. It accurately counts all valid solutions and captures one valid board configuration. The `is_safe` function effectively checks for column and diagonal conflicts, ensuring the correctness of queen placements. Edge cases related to board sizes are inherently managed by the recursive backtracking.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
The backtracking algorithm has a time complexity of O(N!), which is standard for the N-Queens problem and appropriate for typical values of `n` (e.g., 8). The space complexity is O(N) due to the recursion stack and board representation, which is efficient for this problem size.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Utilizes Rust's type system and ownership semantics effectively. The use of `Option<Vec<usize>>` for `one_solution` aligns with Rust's safety guarantees. The implementation leverages Rust's standard library features, such as cloning and vector operations, in an idiomatic manner.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Functions are modular and well-defined (`solve_nqueens`, `is_safe`, `backtrack`). Variable names are clear and descriptive (`count`, `one_solution`, `board`). The code follows Rust's formatting and styling conventions, enhancing readability. Comments provide clarity without being excessive.

**Error Handling**:  
The implementation assumes that `n` is a positive integer. While typical usage ensures valid input, additional checks (e.g., verifying that `n` is greater than zero) could improve robustness.

#### 2) Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
Implements the dynamic programming approach correctly to compute the LCS length and reconstruct one valid subsequence. The DP table is filled based on standard LCS logic, and the backtracking mechanism accurately retrieves the LCS.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
Maintains a time and space complexity of O(mn), which is optimal for the LCS problem. While space optimization to O(min(m, n)) is possible when only the length is needed, the current implementation is appropriate as it reconstructs the subsequence.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Utilizes Rust's vector and string types effectively. The use of `Vec<char>` for string manipulation is idiomatic. The implementation leverages Rust's strong type system and memory safety features without unnecessary complexity.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Code is well-organized with clear function definitions (`lcs`). Variable names are descriptive (`s1_chars`, `dp`, `sequence`). The code adheres to Rust's formatting and styling guidelines, enhancing readability. Comments provide necessary explanations without overcomplicating the code.

**Error Handling**:  
Assumes that input strings are valid and non-empty. Incorporating checks for empty strings or invalid inputs could further enhance robustness.

#### 3) Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
Accurately implements Dijkstra's algorithm using Rust's `BinaryHeap` with `Reverse` wrappers to create a min-heap. It correctly updates distances and predecessors, ensuring the shortest path and total distance are accurately determined. Handles cases where no path exists by returning `None`.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
Achieves a time complexity of O((E + V) log V) through the use of a priority queue, which is efficient for sparse graphs. The space complexity is appropriate, utilizing vectors and `Option` types for distances and predecessors.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Employs Rust's `BinaryHeap` with `Reverse` for min-heap functionality, which is idiomatic. Uses `Vec<Vec<(usize, i32)>>` for graph representation, leveraging Rust's powerful type system. The use of `Option` and error handling aligns with Rust's safety principles.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Functions are modular and purpose-driven (`dijkstra`). Variable names are clear (`dist`, `prev`, `heap`). The code follows Rust's formatting and styling standards, enhancing readability. Comments provide clarity without cluttering the code.

**Error Handling**:  
Handles invalid start or end vertices by returning `None`. Appropriately manages scenarios where no path exists by checking if the distance remains `i32::MAX`. Ensures that unexpected inputs do not cause undefined behavior.

#### Overall Assessment

The Rust implementation is robust, efficient, and highly idiomatic. It effectively leverages Rust's strengths, including its type system and memory safety features. The code is clean, well-structured, and adheres to Rust's best practices. While additional input validations could enhance robustness, the implementations are functionally sound and maintain high code quality.

### C Implementation

#### 1) N-Queens Problem

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
The C implementation accurately solves the N-Queens problem using backtracking. It correctly counts all valid solutions and captures the first valid configuration. The `isSafe` function effectively checks for column and diagonal conflicts, ensuring correct queen placements. Edge cases related to board sizes are managed by the recursive backtracking mechanism.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
The backtracking approach has a time complexity of O(N!), which is standard for the N-Queens problem and suitable for typical `n` values (e.g., 8). The space complexity is O(N) due to the recursion stack and board representation, which is efficient for this problem size.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Utilizes C's pointers and memory management effectively. The use of global variables for `solution_count`, `first_solution`, and `found_solution` simplifies value sharing across recursive calls but can lead to issues in larger or more complex programs. Memory allocation is managed carefully within the Dijkstra's implementation, but global variables could be avoided for better modularity.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Code is organized with clear separation of functions (`solveNQueens`, `isSafe`, `solveNQueensUtil`). Variable names are descriptive (`solution_count`, `first_solution`). However, the use of global variables can reduce modularity and increase coupling. Comments are thorough and aid in understanding the approach.

**Error Handling**:  
Includes checks for memory allocation failures in `add_edge`. However, additional input validations (e.g., ensuring `n` is within acceptable bounds) could improve robustness. The use of fixed-size arrays (e.g., `NQUEEN`) limits flexibility but simplifies implementation.

#### 2) Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
Implements the dynamic programming approach correctly to compute the LCS length and reconstructs one valid subsequence. The DP table is accurately filled based on standard LCS logic, and the backtracking mechanism retrieves the subsequence correctly.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
Maintains a time and space complexity of O(mn), which is optimal for the LCS problem. The implementation uses dynamic memory allocation for the DP table and the LCS string, which is appropriate. However, manual memory management increases the risk of memory leaks or errors.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Leverages C's pointers and dynamic memory management effectively. The use of `malloc`, `memcpy`, and pointer arithmetic is appropriate for the task. However, manual memory management increases complexity and the potential for bugs compared to higher-level languages.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Functions are modular with clear purposes (`longest_common_subsequence`). Variable names are descriptive (`dp`, `lcs_str`). Code adheres to standard C formatting and styling practices. Comments are comprehensive and aid understanding.

**Error Handling**:  
Checks for memory allocation failures and handles cases where no LCS exists by allocating appropriate memory. Ensures that all dynamically allocated memory is freed to prevent memory leaks. However, the use of fixed-size buffers (e.g., `lcs_str`) could be made more flexible.

#### 3) Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
Implements Dijkstra's algorithm correctly using an adjacency list representation. The use of an O(V²) approach for selecting the minimum distance vertex is straightforward and ensures correctness. It accurately updates distances and predecessors, reconstructing the shortest path as expected. Handles cases where no path exists by checking if the distance remains `INT_MAX`.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
Uses an adjacency list with an O(V²) time complexity, which is suitable for small graphs but not optimal for larger or sparse graphs. Utilizing a more efficient priority queue (e.g., binary heap) could reduce the time complexity to O((E + V) log V).

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Utilizes C's structures and pointers effectively to represent the graph and edges. Manual memory management is handled carefully, with functions to add edges and free the graph's memory. However, the lack of higher-level abstractions in C makes the implementation more verbose and prone to errors compared to higher-level languages.

**Code Quality and Structure**:  
Functions are modular with clear purposes (`add_edge`, `solveNQueens`, `longest_common_subsequence`, `dijkstra`). Variable names are descriptive (`dist`, `visited`, `prev`). Code adheres to standard C formatting practices. However, the use of global variables for `V` and other parameters reduces flexibility.

**Error Handling**:  
Includes checks for memory allocation failures and handles cases where no path exists by printing appropriate messages. Ensures that all dynamically allocated memory for the graph is freed at the end. However, the use of fixed-size arrays (e.g., `V`) limits flexibility and scalability.

#### Overall Assessment

The C implementation is functional and accurately solves all three problems. It correctly implements the algorithms with appropriate use of data structures and memory management. However, the reliance on global variables and manual memory management increases complexity and potential for bugs. The Dijkstra's implementation could benefit from more efficient data structures to improve performance for larger graphs. Overall, the code is well-documented and organized but lacks some flexibility and efficiency compared to higher-level language implementations.

### Evaluation Critique

**1. Algorithmic Correctness**
- **N-Queens Problem**:
  - All implementations correctly solve the N-Queens Problem by using backtracking to prevent conflicts between queens. No logical errors or unhandled edge cases were found in any of the implementations.

- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**:
  - Both TypeScript and Rust implementations correctly solve the LCS using dynamic programming and correctly reconstruct one valid longest common subsequence. The Python implementation also correctly uses dynamic programming but could benefit from clearer variable names and comments.

- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**:
  - All implementations correctly solve Dijkstra's shortest path problem. TypeScript and Rust use a priority queue for efficiency, while the C implementation uses an O(V²) approach without a priority queue for simplicity. The C implementation is correct but less efficient.

**2. Algorithmic Efficiency**
- **N-Queens Problem**:
  - The time complexity for the N-Queens problem is O(N!), which is unavoidable given the combinatorial nature of the problem. The implementations are efficient in terms of time complexity but could slightly improve by reducing overheads in backtracking.

- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**:
  - The time complexity for LCS is O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings. All implementations achieve this bound, but the Python implementation could slightly improve by reducing unnecessary variable creations.

- **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**:
  - The time complexity for Dijkstra's algorithm is O((V + E)logV), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. The TypeScript and Rust implementations achieve this using a priority queue, while the C implementation uses an O(V²) loop which is less efficient but acceptable for its simplicity.

**3. Language-Specific Implementation**
- **TypeScript Implementation**:
  - The TypeScript implementation leverages TypeScript's type system effectively using interfaces and generics. The code is well-organized and idiomatic for modern JavaScript/TypeScript developers.

- **Python Implementation**:
  - The Python implementation is clear and concise, adhering to Python’s syntax and idioms. However, some variable names could be more descriptive, and additional comments might help readability for non-experts.

- **Rust Implementation**:
  - The Rust implementation is highly idiomatic and leverages Rust’s strengths, such as compile-time evaluations and memory safety features. The use of binary heap for priority queue operations is particularly efficient.

- **C Implementation**:
  - The C implementation is straightforward and leverages standard C structures like arrays and linked lists. However, it does not handle memory errors as robustly as modern languages like TypeScript or Rust.

**4. Code Quality and Structure**
- **TypeScript Implementation**:
  - The code is well-organized with clear function definitions and comments. The use of TypeScript type annotations improves readability by clearly defining the expected inputs and outputs.

- **Python Implementation**:
  - The structure is clear, but some functions could be refactored for better modularity. Variable names like `dp` and `s1` could be more descriptive.

- **Rust Implementation**:
  - The code is highly structured with clear function definitions. It leverages Rust’s pattern matching for decision logic, making it concise and easy to understand.

- **C Implementation**:
  - The structure is simple but somewhat less modular due to its procedural nature. Variable names are mostly clear but could benefit from additional comments for better readability.

**5. Error Handling**
- **TypeScript Implementation**:
  - Error handling is robust with checks like verifying vertex existence when calling Dijkstra's algorithm.

- **Python Implementation**:
  - Error handling is basic but sufficient for this specific implementation. It could benefit from more comprehensive error handling like checking for invalid input lengths in LCS function.

- **Rust Implementation**:
  - Error handling is robust with Rust’s built-in error handling mechanisms like using `Option` or `Result` types.

- **C Implementation**:
  - Error handling is less robust with direct memory allocation not checked robustly (e.g., null pointer checks).

### Overall Assessment

Given the above analysis, here is the overall evaluation:

**Grade: A**

The implementations are largely correct, efficient, and idiomatic for their respective languages. However, minor improvements can be suggested for better readability, robust error handling, and modularity, especially in the Python and C implementations. The TypeScript and Rust implementations are particularly strong due to their extensive use of type safety features and modern programming practices.

Okay, I will rigorously evaluate the provided N-Queens, LCS, and Dijkstra implementations in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C, according to the specified criteria.

**TypeScript Implementation (main.ts)**

1.  **Algorithmic Correctness**: The N-Queens, LCS, and Dijkstra algorithms are all correctly implemented. The N-Queens backtracking logic is sound, the LCS dynamic programming recurrence is accurate, and Dijkstra's algorithm correctly calculates the shortest paths.  The handling of the start node not being in the graph within Dijkstra is a definite plus.

2.  **Algorithmic Efficiency**:
    *   N-Queens: Backtracking is inherently exponential, but the `isSafe` function and pruning of the search space are appropriately optimized.
    *   LCS: Dynamic programming provides an optimal time complexity of O(m\*n) and space complexity of O(m\*n), for sequences of lengths m and n.
    *   Dijkstra: Using a priority queue is the correct approach. The implemented binary heap-based priority queue provides a time complexity of O((|V| + |E|)log|V|) in the best case.

3.  **Language-Specific Implementation**:
    *   The code is generally idiomatic TypeScript. The use of `interface` for `Edge` provides good type safety. The use of `Map` for the graph and distances/previous is also a good choice. The priority queue implementation is a reasonable choice given that a built-in one isn't readily available in TypeScript.

4.  **Code Quality and Structure**:
    *   The code is well-organized and readable. Function and variable names are appropriate. The comments provide clear explanations.

5.  **Error Handling**: The code has error handling in Dijkstra's algorithm by checking to start node existence and returning null when not found or no path exists.

Grade: A

**Python Implementation (main.py)**

1.  **Algorithmic Correctness**:The algorithms are correctly implemented. The N-Queens backtracking, LCS dynamic programming, and Dijkstra's shortest path logic are all sound.

2.  **Algorithmic Efficiency**:
    *   N-Queens: Same as TypeScript, backtracking is exponential, but the pruning is appropriate.
    *   LCS: O(m\*n) time and space complexity.
    *   Dijkstra: Uses `heapq`, which is a Python's built-in min-heap implementation and an excellent and efficient choice. Thus time complexity is O((|V| + |E|)log|V|), similar to optimal priority queue approaches.

3.  **Language-Specific Implementation**:
    *   The code is idiomatic Python.  Good use of list comprehensions for DP table initialization and enumerate for the solution printing within the N-Queens problem. Using `heapq` makes the Dijkstra implementation clean.

4.  **Code Quality and Structure**: Code is well-organized, readable, and uses appropriate variable and function names. Comments are clear.

5.  **Error Handling**: The `dijkstra` function returns `None` if no path is found which is correct implementation/error handling

Grade: A+

**Rust Implementation (main.rs)**

1.  **Algorithmic Correctness**: The N-Queens, LCS, and Dijkstra's algorithms are all correctly implemented.

2.  **Algorithmic Efficiency**:
    *   N-Queens: Backtracking with appropriate pruning.
    *   LCS: O(m\*n) time and space complexity.
    *   Dijkstra: Uses `BinaryHeap` which is Rust's built-in Max-Heap implementation. However, Dijkstra is generally implemented using Min-Heap. The code uses `std::cmp::Reverse` to use the Max-Heap as a Min-Heap, which is the correct approach. The time complexity is thus O((|V| + |E|)log|V|).

3.  **Language-Specific Implementation**:
    *   This is an idiomatic Rust implementation. The use of `Option` for potentially missing solutions and `Result` (though not explicitly used here, it *could* be used to enhance error handling) are appreciated. The handling of string slices and character vectors is appropriate.
    *   The use of `saturating_add` addresses potential overflow issues, demonstrating good attention to detail.

4.  **Code Quality and Structure**:
    *   The code quality is excellent. It's well-structured, readable, and uses appropriate naming conventions.

5.  **Error Handling**: Start and end indices are verified to be within the graph, and the `Option` return type provides a clean mechanism for indicating failure in `dijkstra`.

Grade: A+

**C Implementation (main.c)**

1.  **Algorithmic Correctness**: The N-Queens and LCS are correct. Dijkstra's algorithm is also functionally correct.

2.  **Algorithmic Efficiency**:
    *   N-Queens: Backtracking, as expected.
    *   LCS: O(m\*n) time and space complexity.
    *   Dijkstra: Implemented with an O(V^2) selection for the next vertex, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(V^2 + E). This is less efficient than the priority queue-based implementations in TypeScript and Rust, especially for sparse graphs.  While the note explicitly mentions that this was intentional, the performance impact should be noted.

3.  **Language-Specific Implementation**:  The code adheres to C's style conventions.  The use of `malloc` and `free` is necessary for memory management, but it requires careful handling to avoid leaks.

4.  **Code Quality and Structure**: Code is reasonably well-organized, but lacks some of the higher-level abstractions available in the other languages. The comments are helpful.

5.  **Error Handling**: Includes rudimentary error handling for memory allocation failures.

Grade: B

## TypeScript Implementation (main.ts)

**1) Algorithmic Correctness:** Correct implementations for all three algorithms. The N-Queens algorithm finds all solutions and correctly prints one. LCS and Dijkstra also produce correct results.

**2) Algorithmic Efficiency:**
    * N-Queens: Inherent exponential complexity, implemented efficiently using backtracking.
    * LCS: Standard dynamic programming approach with O(m*n) time and space complexity.
    * Dijkstra: The use of a custom Priority Queue implementation is less efficient than using the built-in `PriorityQueue` class (available since Node v18.8.0). The custom implementation has `O(n)` insertion and extraction, leading to `O(V^2)` overall time complexity for Dijkstra's algorithm, instead of the optimal `O(E log V)` with a min-heap based priority queue.

**3) Language-Specific Implementation:** Generally good use of TypeScript features like interfaces and types.  Could benefit from more functional programming paradigms in certain places.  Notably, avoiding mutations and using more functional techniques could improve the backtracking algorithm. 

**4) Code Quality and Structure:** Good code structure and readability. Clear comments and variable names.

**5) Error Handling:** Dijkstra's handles the cases where the start or end node are not present, printing an error message and returning null. N-Queens and LCS don't have explicit input validation but the implementation handles empty strings and invalid input correctly.


**Improvements:**
* Use the built-in `PriorityQueue` in later Node versions or an existing well-tested library for the priority queue in Dijkstra’s algorithm.
* Consider more functional style programming techniques to decrease code mutation.


Grade: A-


## Python Implementation (main.py)

**1) Algorithmic Correctness:**  Correct implementations.

**2) Algorithmic Efficiency:** All algorithms are implemented efficiently using standard optimal approaches: backtracking for N-Queens, dynamic programming for LCS, and a min-heap based priority queue (using heapq module) for Dijkstra's.

**3) Language-Specific Implementation:** Idiomatic Python code. Leveraging list comprehensions and generators would improve parts of it.

**4) Code Quality and Structure:**  Well-structured and readable code.  Use of docstrings is commendable.

**5) Error Handling:**  Dijkstra's handles cases where a path doesn’t exist. N-Queens and LCS gracefully handle edge cases relating to empty string inputs.


**Improvements:** Explore more functional approaches or list comprehensions for backtracking to reduce mutation and potentially improve conciseness.


Grade: A-


## Rust Implementation (main.rs)

**1) Algorithmic Correctness:** Correct implementations.

**2) Algorithmic Efficiency:** Efficient implementations for all three, appropriate use of data structures including `BinaryHeap` providing good time complexity for Dijkstra's.

**3) Language-Specific Implementation:**  Generally good. Could benefit from using more iterators and functional-style Rust idioms.

**4) Code Quality and Structure:**  Clear and well-organized code.  Good comments.

**5) Error Handling:**  Rust implementation handles graph bounds checking in Dijkstra’s. N-Queens and LCS correctly handle empty inputs. Consider adding message printing or error types for Dijkstra's failures.


**Improvements:** Return a `Result` type in `dijkstra` instead of `Option` to indicate the nature of a failed search.


Grade: A-


## C Implementation (main.c)

**1) Algorithmic Correctness:** The implementations are correctly solving the problems.

**2) Algorithmic Efficiency:**  N-Queens and LCS have optimal implementations. However, Dijkstra's algorithm implementation uses a simple adjacency list with an O(V^2) approach in its main loop where it selects thenext node to process from the unvisited. This is less efficient than a heap based priority queue with O(E log V) complexity.

**3) Language-Specific Implementation:**  Appropriately uses C idioms but could benefit from using more concise pointer arithmetic in places.

**4) Code Quality and Structure:** Generally well-organized.  Memory allocation is handled responsibly with `free` calls. Error handling during allocation is limited but present.  Adding more detailed error messages and some return code mechanisms beyond exiting would be better.

**5) Error Handling:**  Dijkstra's handles the condition where no path is found and prints a message. But more robust error handling would be preferable.


**Improvements:**
* Memory allocation error handling could be improved by checking every malloc return and printing out which data structure failed to allocate.
* Use a priority queue for Dijkstra's algorithm to improve time complexity.
* Consider using `size_t` for array indexing and when dealing with string lengths.
* Consider using a function to allocate an array of specified size to reduce repetitive malloc and error checking if allocations fail.

Below is a constructive, point-by-point critique of each language’s implementations, followed by an overall letter grade for that language. The grades are assigned from the set {A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-}.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
▶ TypeScript Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness  
   • N-Queens: Correct backtracking approach places one queen per row and checks column and diagonal conflicts. The solution correctly counts total solutions (for n=8) and captures the first valid board.  
   • Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): Standard dynamic programming with a (m+1)×(n+1) table, followed by a correct backtrack to reconstruct one valid LCS. Handles empty substrings correctly.  
   • Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Correct priority-queue-based approach (min-heap) for shortest paths. Properly initializes distances and updates them when a better path is found. Correctly reconstructs the path if one exists.  

2) Algorithmic Efficiency  
   • N-Queens: O(n!) backtracking is expected for this classic problem, and the approach is conventional.  
   • LCS: O(mn) time, O(mn) space complexity is standard and optimal.  
   • Dijkstra’s: Uses a custom binary heap, achieving roughly O(E log V). This is appropriate and efficient for a typical adjacency-list-based Dijkstra.  

3) Language-Specific Implementation  
   • Uses TypeScript features effectively: custom interfaces (Edge), a PriorityQueue class, and typed function signatures.  
   • Could consider using more built-in data structures (e.g., external libraries for a priority queue), but this custom implementation is still clear and instructive.  

4) Code Quality and Structure  
   • Code is clean, well-organized, and maintains consistent naming.  
   • Functions are concise and documented with comments, aiding maintainability.  

5) Error Handling  
   • Prints console.error if the start vertex is missing or if no path is found in Dijkstra’s.  
   • N-Queens and LCS rely on conventional usage; no major error cases aside from possibly handling very small n values in N-Queens.  

Overall, the TypeScript code is clear, correct, and idiomatic.  

Grade: A

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
▶ Python Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness  
   • N-Queens: Correctly backtracks over all columns per row. Maintains and returns one valid solution in addition to the total count.  
   • LCS: Standard DP approach with a 2D table. Backtracking to rebuild one LCS is correct.  
   • Dijkstra’s: Properly uses heapq for a priority queue. Checks stale distances (if d > dist[u]) to continue, which is a common and correct optimization.  

2) Algorithmic Efficiency  
   • N-Queens: O(n!) backtracking, as expected.  
   • LCS: O(mn) time and space.  
   • Dijkstra’s: O(E log V) using a binary heap for edges in adjacency lists.  

3) Language-Specific Implementation  
   • Very Pythonic style, using lists, dictionaries, and heapq idioms.  
   • Straightforward function-based approach, with a main() to demonstrate usage.  

4) Code Quality and Structure  
   • Readable, concise code. Good use of nonlocal for capturing global counters in N-Queens.  
   • Well-structured DP and reconstruction logic in LCS.  

5) Error Handling  
   • Some potential edge cases (e.g., if start not in graph) could cause key errors, but as an example script, this is acceptable.  
   • Otherwise, prints “No path” if none found in Dijkstra’s.  

Overall, the Python code is both clear and canonical.  

Grade: A

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
▶ Rust Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness  
   • N-Queens: Uses a backtracking function that checks column and diagonal conflicts and updates the count. Returns the first valid solution when found.  
   • LCS: Employs a typical DP table. Reconstructs one valid subsequence by tracing from dp[m][n] backward to dp[0][0].  
   • Dijkstra's: Leverages a BinaryHeap with Reverse so the smallest distance is always extracted first. Properly relaxes edges and reconstructs the path.  

2) Algorithmic Efficiency  
   • N-Queens: O(n!) is standard for backtracking.  
   • LCS: O(mn) DP approach is optimal.  
   • Dijkstra’s: O(E log V) with a priority queue, typical for adjacency-list-based graphs. Uses saturating_add to guard against overflows, showing attention to detail.  

3) Language-Specific Implementation  
   • Idiomatic Rust patterns: Option for storing solutions, usage of slices, and ownership of vectors.  
   • The code is neatly modularized into functions with well-chosen signatures and types.  

4) Code Quality and Structure  
   • Organized into separate functions for each algorithm. Variables are named clearly.  
   • Error cases (like out-of-bounds start/end) are handled by returning None.  

5) Error Handling  
   • Gracefully returns None when invalid start/end indices exist or no path is found in Dijkstra’s.  
   • N-Queens and LCS are used with their conventional boundaries; no major error conditions.  

Overall, the Rust code is robust, well-structured, and demonstrates good Rust idioms.  

Grade: A

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness  
   • N-Queens: Uses global variables (solution_count, etc.) and a standard backtracking method. Correctly increments the count and saves the first solution.  
   • LCS: Standard (m+1)×(n+1) DP table and backtracking to reconstruct one subsequence. Frees allocated memory properly.  
   • Dijkstra’s: A straightforward O(V²) core loop plus adjacency lists using linked structures. Correctly relaxes edges, updates distances, and reconstructs the final path.  

2) Algorithmic Efficiency  
   • N-Queens: O(n!) for backtracking.  
   • LCS: O(mn) for the DP approach.  
   • Dijkstra’s: O(V²) for the selection of the next minimum-dist vertex, which is acceptable for small V but not as efficient as a priority queue.  

3) Language-Specific Implementation  
   • Reasonable C style: adjacency lists are stored as linked lists, memory is managed via malloc/free.  
   • Relies on #define for NQUEEN and V, making it less flexible but straightforward. Global variables in N-Queens reduce modularity.  

4) Code Quality and Structure  
   • The code is largely in one file, with some global state (e.g., solution_count). This is not as modular, but typical for a short C example.  
   • Naming is reasonably clear; the adjacency list approach is functional but a bit verbose.  

5) Error Handling  
   • Prints a message and returns if no path is found in Dijkstra’s. Checks malloc return in add_edge.  
   • Does not handle out-of-range NQUEEN or V gracefully (hard-coded macros).  

Overall, the C code is correct and relatively clear but less modular than the other versions and uses global variables in places.

**TypeScript Implementation Evaluation**

1. **Algorithmic Correctness**: All algorithms are correctly implemented with appropriate backtracking, DP, and Dijkstra's logic. Edge cases (e.g., no LCS, no path in Dijkstra) are handled.
2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Optimal time/space complexities for N-Queens (O(n!)), LCS (O(mn)), and Dijkstra's (O((E+V) log V)). The custom priority queue is well-implemented.
3. **Language-Specific**: Uses TypeScript's types and classes effectively. Code is idiomatic.
4. **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and modular with clear variable names. Includes proper TypeScript types.
5. **Error Handling**: Checks for invalid start nodes in Dijkstra. Missing checks for invalid end nodes (but handled by distance checks).

**Grade: A**

**Python Implementation Evaluation**

1. **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correct implementations. No edge-case misses. Dijkstra handles outdated heap entries correctly.
2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Uses built-in `heapq` for O((E+V) log V) Dijkstra. Backtracking and DP are optimal.
3. **Language-Specific**: Pythonic with list comprehensions, `heapq`, and tuple unpacking. Globals in N-Queens are minor but acceptable.
4. **Code Quality**: Concise and readable. Functions are well-structured.
5. **Error Handling**: Returns `None` for no path. Misses some edge cases in N-Queens (but none critical).

**Grade: A**

**Rust Implementation Evaluation**

1. **Algorithmic Correctness**: All algorithms adhere to specifications. Dijkstra uses proper priority queues. Safe graph indexing.
2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Reversed `BinaryHeap` for Dijkstra, DP for LCS, and backtracking are optimal.
3. **Language-Specific**: Idiomatic with `Vec`, `Option`, and explicit error handling. Avoids unsafe code.
4. **Code Quality**: Clear and modular. Uses immutable borrows and ownership effectively.
5. **Error Handling**: Checks node existence in Dijkstra. Handles empty LCS gracefully.

**Grade: A**

**C Implementation Evaluation**

1. **Algorithmic Correctness**: **Major flaws**: N-Queens is limited to 8-Queens, Dijkstra's graph size is fixed (V=6). LCS works.
2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Dijkstra's O(V²) is suboptimal but correct for fixed V. Manual adjacency lists are acceptable.
3. **Language-Specific**: Not idiomatic (global variables in N-Queens), but typical of low-level C code.
4. **Code Quality**: Poorly structured with global state (N-Queens) and hard-coded sizes. Memory management (freeing) is correct.
5. **Error Handling**: Missing checks for invalid nodes in Dijkstra. Non-reentrant N-Queens due to globals.
