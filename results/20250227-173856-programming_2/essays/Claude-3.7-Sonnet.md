# Algorithmic Problems Implementation

I'll implement the requested problems in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C.

## 1. N-Queens Problem

### TypeScript Implementation
```typescript
/**
 * N-Queens solver using backtracking
 * Returns the count of solutions and one valid solution
 */
function solveNQueens(n: number = 8): { count: number; solution: string[][] } {
  const board: string[][] = Array(n).fill(null).map(() => Array(n).fill('.'));
  let count = 0;
  let oneSolution: string[][] = [];

  // Check if a position is valid for placing a queen
  function isValid(row: number, col: number): boolean {
    // Check column
    for (let i = 0; i < row; i++) {
      if (board[i][col] === 'Q') return false;
    }

    // Check upper left diagonal
    for (let i = row - 1, j = col - 1; i >= 0 && j >= 0; i--, j--) {
      if (board[i][j] === 'Q') return false;
    }

    // Check upper right diagonal
    for (let i = row - 1, j = col + 1; i >= 0 && j < n; i--, j++) {
      if (board[i][j] === 'Q') return false;
    }

    return true;
  }

  function backtrack(row: number): void {
    if (row === n) {
      count++;
      if (count === 1) {
        // Store the first solution
        oneSolution = board.map(row => [...row]);
      }
      return;
    }

    for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
      if (isValid(row, col)) {
        board[row][col] = 'Q';
        backtrack(row + 1);
        board[row][col] = '.';  // Backtrack
      }
    }
  }

  backtrack(0);
  return { count, solution: oneSolution };
}

// Test the 8-Queens problem
const { count, solution } = solveNQueens(8);
console.log(`Total solutions: ${count}`);
console.log("One valid solution:");
solution.forEach(row => console.log(row.join(' ')));
```

# Grading Feedback

## Graded by: Llama-3-8B

Here is my evaluation of the implementations:

**1. N-Queens Problem**

All implementations correctly solve the N-Queens problem using backtracking. The code is well-structured, and the logic is easy to follow. However, the TypeScript and Python implementations do not handle the case where there are no solutions (i.e., when the board is fully occupied) explicitly. The C and Rust implementations correctly return a count of 0 in this case.

The algorithmic complexity is O(n^2) for initializing the board and O(n) for the backtracking, which is optimal for this problem.

Language-specific implementation:
- TypeScript and Python implementations are idiomatic. The TypeScript code uses type annotations, and the Python code uses a more concise syntax. However, the Python code lacks type hints.
- C implementation leverages the strengths of C with its explicit memory management, but some code duplication occurs.
- Rust implementation uses smart pointers and error handling mechanisms, making it more robust.

Code quality and structure:
- All implementations are well-organized and easy to read.
- TypeScript and Python implementations use consistent naming conventions. The C implementation uses mostly consistent naming conventions, but some variables have different casing.
- The Rust implementation uses a consistent naming convention and includes helpful comments.

Error handling:
- All implementations handle potential errors (e.g., invalid inputs) in a way that makes sense for the language.

Grade: B+

**2. Longest Common Subsequence**

All implementations correctly solve the Longest Common Subsection problem using dynamic programming.

The algorithmic complexity is O(n*m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings, which is optimal for this problem.

Language-specific implementation:
- TypeScript and Python implementations are idiomatic. The TypeScript code uses clear variable names, while the Python code is concise.
- C implementation leverages the strengths of C with its pointer arithmetic, but some code duplication occurs.
- Rust implementation uses smart pointers and iterator manipulation, making it more efficient.

Code quality and structure:
- All implementations are well-organized and easy to read.
- TypeScript and Python implementations use consistent naming conventions. The C implementation uses mostly consistent naming conventions, but some variables have different casing.
- The Rust implementation uses a consistent naming convention and includes helpful comments.

Error handling:
- All implementations handle potential errors (e.g., invalid inputs) in a way that makes sense for the language.

Grade: B+

**3. Dijkstra's Shortest Path**

All implementations correctly solve the shortest path problem using Dijkstra's algorithm.

The algorithmic complexity is O(|E|log|V|), which is optimal for this problem.

Let's rigorously evaluate the implementations provided for the N-Queens problem, Longest Common Subsequence, and Dijkstra's algorithm in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C.

## Evaluation of Implementations

### 1. N-Queens Problem

#### TypeScript Implementation
1. **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation correctly uses backtracking to solve the N-Queens problem. It correctly counts the number of solutions and returns one valid configuration. However, it might fail if n is less than 1 since it does not check for valid input.
  
2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The time complexity is O(N!), with additional O(N^2) space for storing the board. This is acceptable for smaller N, but significant optimizations are not present. Storing additional valid boards could consume unnecessary memory.

3. **Language-Specific Implementation**: Utilizes idiomatic TypeScript features like `Array.fill` and type definitions effectively.

4. **Code Quality and Structure**: Code is well-structured, with appropriately named functions. The documentation is present but could be more detailed regarding function parameters.

5. **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling. It assumes the input will always be valid and doesn't manage cases for `n <= 0`.

**Critique**: No major bugs; minor improvements in error handling should be made.

#### Python Implementation
1. **Algorithmic Correctness**: Functions well for the N-Queens problem without errors. Similar to TypeScript, it doesn't handle cases where n < 1.

2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Similar complexity to TypeScript; however, the use of lists and simple loops maintains efficient memory usage.

3. **Language-Specific Implementation**: Python list comprehensions and the `nonlocal` keyword are used appropriately.

4. **Code Quality and Structure**: Well-organized, and functionally decomposed. Variables are appropriately named.

5. **Error Handling**: Same shortcomings regarding n < 1, but otherwise sound.

**Critique**: Lacks validation for input.

#### Rust Implementation
1. **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly identifies and handles the N-Queens problem, counting solutions properly.

2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The method is efficient in terms of memory usage, and it cleanly uses Rust's ownership model. The complexity remains O(N!).

3. **Language-Specific Implementation**: Leverages Rust's ownership and the `Vec` type idiomatically. The use of iterators where possible improves readability and efficiency.

4. **Code Quality and Structure**: Code is well-structured, has clear comments, and scales well. Naming is consistent and clear.

5. **Error Handling**: Similar issues with validating input n. 

**Critique**: Proper use of Rust features, but lacks validation for input `n`.

#### C Implementation
1. **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation is correct; it adheres well to the logic of backtracking.

2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Like others, it takes O(N!) time. Uses fixed-size board resources that limit scalability.

3. **Language-Specific Implementation**: While it uses C pointers effectively, it lacks C idioms like `malloc` checks and error messages if allocation fails.

### TypeScript Implementations

#### 1. N-Queens Problem

**Algorithmic Correctness**:
- **Strengths**: The implementation correctly employs backtracking to solve the N-Queens problem. It counts all possible solutions and captures the first valid solution effectively.
- **Weaknesses**: The method assumes the board is always square and doesn't handle cases where `n` is less than 1. Additionally, for very large `n`, the solution storage (`oneSolution`) can become memory-intensive.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:
- **Strengths**: Utilizes a standard backtracking approach with pruning by checking column and both diagonals, reducing unnecessary computations.
- **Weaknesses**: Time complexity remains O(N!), which is expected for this problem, but using bitwise operations or optimizations like symmetry breaking could enhance performance. The use of a 2D array (`board`) increases space complexity to O(N²).

**Language-Specific Implementation**:
- **Strengths**: Leverages TypeScript's type system effectively, ensuring type safety with explicit types for function parameters and return types.
- **Weaknesses**: Uses recursive functions without memoization or tail call optimization, which could lead to stack overflow for large `n`.

**Code Quality and Structure**:
- **Strengths**: The code is well-organized with clear function separation (`isValid`, `backtrack`). Variable names are descriptive, enhancing readability.
- **Weaknesses**: The use of comments is adequate but could be expanded for clarity. The `solution` is stored as a 2D array of strings, which might be inefficient.

**Error Handling**:
- **Strengths**: Defaults `n` to 8, avoiding undefined behavior when no input is provided.
- **Weaknesses**: Doesn't handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative `n`, non-integer values). There's no validation to ensure `n` is within a reasonable range.

---

#### 2. Longest Common Subsequence

**Algorithmic Correctness**:
- **Strengths**: Correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the LCS, accurately reconstructing the subsequence.
- **Weaknesses**: Edge cases where inputs contain special characters or are non-ASCII are not specifically addressed, though the general logic remains sound.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:
- **Strengths**: Time and space complexities are optimal at O(N*M), where N and M are the lengths of the input strings.
- **Weaknesses**: Space optimization techniques (like using only two rows for the DP table) are not utilized, resulting in higher space usage.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:
- **Strengths**: Makes good use of TypeScript's array manipulation capabilities. The use of template literals for output is idiomatic.
- **Weaknesses**: Could leverage more TypeScript features, such as generics or tuples, for enhanced type safety and clarity.

**Code Quality and Structure**:
- **Strengths**: The code is modular with clearly defined functions. Variable names like `dp`, `lcs`, `i`, and `j` are conventional and understandable.
- **Weaknesses**: The reconstruction of the LCS builds the string by prepending characters, which is less efficient than appending and reversing at the end.

**Error Handling**:
- **Strengths**: Checks for empty input strings and returns appropriate results.
- **Weaknesses**: Does not handle null or undefined inputs explicitly, which could lead to runtime errors.

---

#### 3. Graph Traversal - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

**Algorithmic Correctness**:
- **Strengths**: Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm for undirected graphs. Accurately reconstructs the shortest path and calculates the total distance.
- **Weaknesses**: Assumes that the graph has no negative weight edges, which is a standard assumption for Dijkstra's but isn't explicitly enforced.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:
- **Strengths**: Uses a simple array-based priority queue, which is acceptable for smaller graphs.
- **Weaknesses**: The priority queue implementation has O(V) time complexity for extracting the minimum, leading to an overall time complexity of O(V²). Utilizing a binary heap or a more efficient priority queue would improve performance to O((V + E) log V).

**Language-Specific Implementation**:
- **Strengths**: Utilizes TypeScript classes and encapsulates graph logic within a `Graph` class. Employs TypeScript's `Map` for the adjacency list, which is appropriate.
- **Weaknesses**: The priority queue is implemented using an array, which isn't idiomatic for performance-critical operations in TypeScript. Libraries or more efficient data structures could be employed.

**Code Quality and Structure**:
- **Strengths**: The `Graph` class is well-defined with clear methods (`addEdge`, `dijkstra`). Code is readable and functions are appropriately abstracted.
- **Weaknesses**: Error messages are generic. The `dijkstra` method could be broken down into smaller helper functions for clarity.

**Error Handling**:
- **Strengths**: Validates vertex indices when adding edges and running Dijkstra's algorithm, throwing errors for invalid inputs.
- **Weaknesses**: Does not handle exceptions that may arise from improper usage beyond invalid vertices, such as non-integer weights.

- **Weaknesses**: Does not handle `None` inputs or non-string types, which could result in runtime errors.

---

#### 3. Graph Traversal - Shortest Path (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

**Algorithmic Correctness**:
- **Strengths**: Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue (heapq), ensuring optimal shortest path computation for graphs without negative weights.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:
- **Strengths**: Utilizes Python's `heapq` for an efficient priority queue, reducing the time complexity to O((V + E) log V).
- **Weaknesses**: None significant; the implementation is efficient for standard use cases.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:
- **Strengths**: Leverages Python's `heapq` and `defaultdict` effectively. Uses tuple unpacking and concise syntax that is idiomatic.
- **Weaknesses**: The use of `heapq` tuples without defining a separate class for the state can sometimes lead to less readable code, but it's acceptable in Python.

**Code Quality and Structure**:
- **Strengths**: Clear class-based structure with methods for adding edges and performing Dijkstra's algorithm. Readable code with appropriate use of comments and docstrings.
- **Weaknesses**: The path reconstruction could be made more efficient or clearer, but it's functionally correct.

**Error Handling**:
- **Strengths**: Validates vertex indices when adding edges and performing Dijkstra's algorithm, raising exceptions for invalid inputs.
- **Weaknesses**: Does not handle scenarios where the input graph is malformed beyond invalid vertex indices.

---

#### 1. N-Queens Problem

**Algorithmic Correctness**:
- **Strengths**: Accurately implements the backtracking approach in Rust, correctly counting solutions and capturing the first valid solution.
- **Weaknesses**: Similar assumptions as other languages regarding valid `n` values. No explicit handling for invalid input sizes.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:
- **Strengths**: Efficient use of Rust's memory management with vectors. Each recursive call clones necessary data without significant overhead.
- **Weaknesses**: Cloning the board for each solution can be memory-intensive for larger boards. Using bitmasks or more optimized data structures could enhance performance.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:
- **Strengths**: Utilizes Rust's ownership model and memory safety features effectively. The use of `Vec` and iterators is idiomatic.
- **Weaknesses**: Frequent usage of `.to_string()` and cloning strings could be optimized to use more efficient types like `char` or bitmasks.

**Code Quality and Structure**:
- **Strengths**: Clear function separation (`backtrack`, `is_valid`). Good use of comments to explain functionality.
- **Weaknesses**: The use of `String` for board representation is less efficient. Structuring the board as a vector of `Option<usize>` could simplify validity checks.

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:
- **Strengths**: Uses `BinaryHeap` for an efficient priority queue implementation, achieving O((V + E) log V) time complexity.
- **Weaknesses**: In Rust, using tuples in the `BinaryHeap` can be less efficient than using a custom `State` struct with optimized ordering, but the current implementation is acceptable.

**Language-Specific Implementation**:
- **Strengths**: Employs Rust's `HashMap` and `BinaryHeap` effectively. The custom `State` struct with `Ordering` implementations is idiomatic.
- **Weaknesses**: The `State` struct could derive additional traits like `Clone` or `Copy` for better flexibility, though it's not necessary here.

**Code Quality and Structure**:

### Evaluation of N-Queens Problem

#### TypeScript Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation correctly solves the N-Queens problem using backtracking. The `isValid` function properly checks all three constraints (column, diagonals). Edge cases like n=1 and n=0 are implicitly handled (`n=0` returns 0 solutions).
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The time complexity is $O(N!)$, which is optimal for backtracking in this problem. The space complexity is $O(N^2)$ due to the board representation, though optimizations like using a 1D array for column placement could reduce space.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code is idiomatic and makes good use of TypeScript features like `Array.fill` and destructuring in `backtrack`. However, cloning the board for the solution (`board.map(row => [...row])`) could be inefficient for large $N$.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is well-organized, with clear separation between the `isValid`, `backtrack`, and `solveNQueens` functions. Naming conventions are clear, though `oneSolution` could be named more explicitly (e.g., `firstSolution`).
- **Error Handling**: The function assumes valid input (`n` is a non-negative integer). Explicit validation for $N < 1$ could be added.

**Grade: A**

#### Python Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: This implementation is identical in logic to the TypeScript version, with no errors. The use of nonlocal variables for `count` and `one_solution` works well.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity is $O(N!)$, and space complexity is $O(N^2)$. Cloning the board (`[row[:] for row in board]`) is efficient but could still be improved with a 1D representation.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The implementation is Pythonic, using list comprehensions and `while` loops effectively. However, `is_valid` could benefit from using generator expressions for early exits.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is clean and readable, with consistent indentation and naming. The use of `nonlocal` is valid but can be avoided in favor of encapsulating state in a class or dictionary.
- **Error Handling**: Like TypeScript, there is no explicit validation for invalid inputs.

**Grade: A**

#### Rust Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: This implementation accurately solves the problem. The `is_valid` function is robust, and the use of `to_string()` ensures correct string handling.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity is $O(N!)$, and space complexity is $O(N^2)$. The use of `Vec<Vec<String>>` for the board is less efficient than using a vector of integers.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The Rust implementation is well-structured but overly verbose due to the `String` type for the board. Using `Vec<Vec<char>>` or even integers (e.g., `0` for empty, `1` for queen) would be more idiomatic in Rust.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is clean but suffers from verbosity due to excessive cloning (`board.iter().map(|row| row.clone()).collect()`). Variable names could be more concise (e.g., `current_solution` instead of `one_solution`).
- **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling, but Rust's type system prevents most misuse.

**Grade: A-**

#### C Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation is correct and handles all constraints properly. The `isValid` function and `backtrack` are logically sound.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity is $O(N!)$, and space complexity is $O(N^2)$. The fixed-size board (`char board[8][8]`) limits flexibility and scalability for $N > 8$.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code is idiomatic C, but the fixed-size board is a significant drawback. Dynamic memory allocation could make this implementation more robust.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is well-organized, but the lack of abstraction for the board limits flexibility. The use of global variables (`count`, `solution`) is unnecessary and could be avoided.
- **Error Handling**: No input validation is present, and the fixed-size board makes the implementation brittle for larger $N$.

**Grade: B**

---

### Evaluation of Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

#### TypeScript Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation correctly computes both the length and subsequence of LCS using dynamic programming. Edge cases like empty strings are handled.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity is $O(M \times N)$, which is optimal. Space complexity is $O(M \times N)$, and optimizations like reducing the DP table to two rows could be implemented.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The use of `Array.fill` and destructuring for DP table initialization is idiomatic. The code is clean and leverages TypeScript's strong typing.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is well-structured, with clear separation between the DP table population and subsequence reconstruction. Naming conventions are clear.
- **Error Handling**: Handles empty strings gracefully.

**Grade: A**

#### Python Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: This implementation mirrors the TypeScript version, with no errors. Reconstructing the LCS using `reversed` is efficient.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time and space complexities are optimal. Using a generator for subsequence reconstruction is Pythonic.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code is idiomatic Python, with list comprehensions and slicing used effectively. However, converting the string to a list of characters could be avoided for simplicity.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is clean and readable, with good use of Pythonic constructs.
- **Error Handling**: Handles empty strings gracefully.

**Grade: A**

#### Rust Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation correctly computes the LCS, with no errors.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time and space complexities are optimal. However, using `Vec<char>` introduces overhead compared to using byte slices (`&str`).
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code is idiomatic Rust but overly verbose due to `Vec<char>`. The use of iterators could simplify reconstruction.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is clean but verbose. Conversion between `Vec<char>` and `String` adds unnecessary complexity.
- **Error Handling**: Handles empty strings gracefully.

**Grade: A-**

#### C Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation is correct, with no logical errors.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time and space complexities are optimal. However, manual memory management and the lack of abstraction make the code error-prone.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code is idiomatic C, but memory management introduces complexity. Using a static DP table could simplify the implementation.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is well-organized, but manual allocation and deallocation make it harder to maintain.
- **Error Handling**: No input validation is present, and memory leaks could occur if errors are introduced.

**Grade: B**

---

### Evaluation of Dijkstra's Algorithm

#### TypeScript Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation is correct but uses a simple array for the priority queue, which is inefficient.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity is $O(V^2)$ due to the linear scan for the minimum distance. Using a binary heap could reduce this to $O(V \log V + E)$.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code leverages TypeScript's type system and idioms effectively. However, the priority queue implementation is suboptimal.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is clean and modular, with good separation of concerns.
- **Error Handling**: Input validation is present but could be more robust.

**Grade: B+**

#### Python Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation uses a `heapq` priority queue, making it more efficient than the TypeScript version.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity is $O(V \log V + E)$, which is optimal.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code is idiomatic Python, with good use of libraries like `heapq` and `defaultdict`.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is clean and modular.
- **Error Handling**: Input validation is present but could be more robust.

**Grade: A**

#### Rust Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation is correct, using a binary heap for the priority queue.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity is $O(V \log V + E)$, which is optimal.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code is idiomatic Rust, with good use of `BinaryHeap` and custom ordering. However, the `Result` type for error handling could be leveraged more.
- **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is clean and modular but could benefit from more idiomatic error handling.
- **Error Handling**: Uses `Result` effectively but could be more consistent.

**Grade: A-**

#### C Implementation
- **Algorithmic Correctness**: The implementation is correct but uses a simple array for the priority queue, making it inefficient.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time complexity is $O(V^2)$ due to the linear scan for the minimum distance.
- **Language-Specific Implementation**: The code is idiomatic C, with manual memory management adding complexity.

#### Error Handling:
All implementations handle potential errors and edge cases well, particularly in checking for invalid positions and ensuring that all necessary checks are performed to prevent logical errors.

### Longest Common Subsequence

#### Algorithmic Correctness:
All implementations correctly use dynamic programming to find the LCS. They initialize a DP table, fill it according to the recursive relationship, and then reconstruct the subsequence.

#### Efficiency:
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(mn)\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of the two strings.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also \(O(mn)\) for storing the DP table.

#### Language-Specific Implementation:
- **TypeScript:** The implementation is clean but slightly verbose. The array-based DP approach is straightforward.
- **Python:** The implementation is idiomatic and uses functions effectively. The use of lists for DP can be more intuitive.

### Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

#### Algorithmic Correctness:
All implementations correctly implement Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue to efficiently find shortest paths in weighted graphs.

#### Efficiency:
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm has an average time complexity of \(O(|E|+|V|\log |V|)\) using a Fibonacci heap or similar min-heap implementation.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(|V| + |E|)\) for storing distances, predecessors, and the priority queue.

#### Language-Specific Implementation:
- **TypeScript:** The implementation uses aInnerText min-priority queue that is simple but understandable. It leverages TypeScript's type system effectively.
- **Python:** The implementation uses a priority queue from `heapq`, which is elegant and idiomatic. The graph structure is clear and well-defined.
- **Rust:** Rust's `std::collections` module is utilized for a BinaryHeap, ensuring safety and performance. The graph structure is efficiently implemented.
- **C:** The implementation is detailed and handles memory management directly, which can be error-prone but is efficient.

### Code Quality and Structure:
- **TypeScript:** Clear but could benefit from some optimization. The type system enhances robustness.
  
 - **Python:** Transparent and straightforward with good use of built-in collections.

 - **Rust:** Safe and efficient due to borrowing rules. The BinaryHeap ensures minimum delay due to ordering.
   
 - **C:** Detailed but requires careful handling of memory to avoid bugs.

### Error Handling:
1. **TypeScript:** Good practice of checking invalid vertices before proceeding.
2. **Python:** Uses exception handling (`ValueError`) for invalid vertices.
3. **Rust:** Utilizes `Err` types effectively ensuring no runtime errors due to input validation.

## Graded by: Gemini Flash 2.0

Okay, I've reviewed the code for the N-Queens problem, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and Dijkstra's algorithm implementations across TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C. Here's a detailed evaluation:

**1. N-Queens Problem**

**TypeScript Implementation**

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly solves the N-Queens problem using backtracking. The `isValid` function accurately checks for queen placement conflicts.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The backtracking approach is inherently exponential, but the `isValid` function is optimized for quick conflict detection.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Uses TypeScript's type system effectively. The `solveNQueens` function explicitly defines the return type. Array initialization using `Array(n).fill(null).map(() => Array(n).fill('.'))` is a common pattern in JavaScript/TypeScript.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Well-structured and readable. The code follows conventional TypeScript naming conventions.
*   **Error Handling**: No specific error handling is needed for this algorithm because of function arguments default value, it gracefully handles a missing value.
*   **Critique:** The code is good. No major improvements necessary.

```
Grade: A
```

**Python Implementation**

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly solves the N-Queens problem. `is_valid` accurately checks for conflicts.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Backtracking is standard. No obvious inefficiencies.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Idiomatic Python. Uses list comprehensions (e.g., `board = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]`) and the `nonlocal` keyword correctly.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Clean and well-structured. Good naming conventions.
*   **Error Handling**: No specific error handling needed.
*   **Critique:** The copy of the board in `one_solution` is good practice. Can't see any significant area for improvement.

```
Grade: A
```

**Rust Implementation**

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly solves the N-Queens problem. `is_valid` function and backtracking logic are sound.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The efficiency is consistent with the backtracking approach.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Rust's ownership and borrowing rules are carefully managed. The use of `&mut` for the `board`, `count`, and `one_solution` parameters in the `backtrack` function is necessary to allow modification within the recursive calls. The conversion to `isize` is necessary to handle the diagonal checks gracefully. However, using String for each cell is relatively costly.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: The code is well-organized but a bit verbose due to Rust's explicit nature.
*   **Error Handling**: There's no error handling, like checking if N is a reasonable value. Panics can be caused, though by stack overflow.
*   **Critique:** The use of `String` for each cell on the board is inefficient; using a `char` or a custom enum would be more memory-efficient. Passing `n` to the backtrack function could be avoided, it will be implicitly closed over.

```
Grade: B+
```

**C Implementation**

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly solves the N-Queens problem.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Standard backtracking implementation.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Uses C's standard library functions. The code uses pointer arithmetic appropriately. The `isValid` function is correctly implemented.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Well-structured but could benefit from more comments.
*   **Error Handling**: Limited error handling. The code checks for `NULL` after `malloc`, which is good.
*   **Critique**: The lack of dynamic memory allocation for the board limits the `n` to 8 directly in the data and function signatures.  The code could be improved by allocating the board dynamically to support larger `n`. It could also allocate the result to support N != 8, it can't store the result for any other value right now.

```
Grade: B
```

**2. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**

**TypeScript Implementation**

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly computes the length and reconstructs the LCS.

*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Utilizes C's standard library functions. Explicit memory management is handled carefully with `malloc` and `free`.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Well-structured, but it manages memory directly (manual memory management).
*   **Error Handling**: Explicitly checks for `NULL` returns from `malloc`.
*   **Critique**: The caller needs to allocate the memory for `lcs`. The code checks for arguments, but it doesn't do anything with the fact that bad parameters will lead to `0`.

```
Grade: B+
```

**3. Dijkstra's Algorithm**

**TypeScript Implementation**

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Uses a basic array for the priority queue, leading to O(V^2) time complexity.  It is an unoptimized priority queue.

```
Grade: B
```

**Python Implementation**

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Uses the `heapq` module for the priority queue, resulting in O(E + V log V) time complexity.

*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Clean and well-organized.

*   **Critique**: None.

```

*   **Error Handling**: Returns Result to propagate errors to calling function.
*   **Critique**: None.

```
Grade: A

**C Implementation**

*   **Algorithmic Correctness**: Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
*   **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Uses a simple array for finding the minimum distance, resulting in O(V^2) time complexity.
*   **Language-Specific Implementation**: Uses C's standard library functions.
*   **Code Quality and Structure**: Well-structured but verbose due to C's nature.
*   **Error Handling**: Some basic error checking.
*   **Critique**: Using a min-heap (priority queue) would drastically improve the time complexity of the algorithm to O(E + V log V).  Memory could allocated and returned to avoid limitations of fixed-size arrays within main.

# Comprehensive Algorithm Analysis

I'll provide a rigorous evaluation of each algorithm implementation across the four languages, focusing on correctness, efficiency, language idioms, code quality, and error handling.

## 1. N-Queens Problem

### TypeScript Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** The implementation correctly uses backtracking to solve the N-Queens problem. The algorithm checks columns and diagonals properly and accurately counts solutions.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Time complexity is O(n!), which is expected for this problem. The space complexity is O(n²) for the board representation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
■■■ TypeScript Implementation ■■■
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness:
• N-Queens: The backtracking approach accurately checks columns and diagonals for conflicts, and it properly increments the solution count and saves the first solution encountered. This appears logically correct for arbitrary n.  
• Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): Uses a standard 2D dynamic programming approach to compute the length and reconstruct the subsequence by tracing through the DP table. This is correct and handles empty-string edge cases by returning length 0 and an empty subsequence.  
• Dijkstra: The adjacency list and the distance/previous arrays are correctly used for path reconstruction. The stopping condition when the destination is dequeued is valid. The naive array-based selection of the current vertex (finding a min distance in O(V) time) is still correct algorithmically, but it yields O(V² + E) complexity instead of using a priority queue for better performance.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency:
• N-Queens: Backtracking is expected to be O(n!) in the worst case, which is standard.  
• LCS: The DP solution is O(m × n) in time, which is optimal, and the space is also O(m × n).  
• Dijkstra: Implemented with a simple array to find the minimum-distance vertex. For large graphs, this is suboptimal compared to a binary heap or priority queue. Nevertheless, the result is still correct.

3) Language-Specific Implementation:
• Uses classes and typed arrays appropriately. The code is generally idiomatic TypeScript, though a more sophisticated data structure (e.g., a min-heap wrapper) could be used for Dijkstra.  
• The usage of fill(null).map(...) to initialize arrays can be a bit unintuitive; TypeScript developers often prefer Array.from or nested loops for clarity. Otherwise, it's well-structured.

4) Code Quality and Structure:
• Meaningful names (e.g., isValid, backtrack, dijkstra). The partitioning into smaller functions for N-Queens is clean. Class-based Graph structure is organized.  
• Could benefit from more explicit or stricter type annotations in some places, but overall remains readable.

5) Error Handling:
• For Dijkstra, checks source/destination validity and throws an Error when invalid. N-Queens and LCS rely on parameter defaults or quick returns without deeper error checks, which is acceptable for typical usage.

Grade: A-

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
■■■ Python Implementation ■■■
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness:
• N-Queens: The implementation matches the backtracking logic, checking columns and diagonals. Returns the correct count and first solution.  
• LCS: Standard DP approach. It correctly reconstructs the subsequence by appending matching characters in reverse and then reversing the result. This is sound for all string lengths.  
• Dijkstra: Implements a priority queue via heapq, which correctly pops the smallest distance vertex each time. The path reconstruction uses a “prev” list and continues until the queue is empty or the destination is reached.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency:
• N-Queens: As expected, O(n!) in the worst case.  
• LCS: O(m × n) time, which is optimal.  
• Dijkstra: Uses a binary heap, yielding O((E + V) log V) in typical usage, which is more efficient than a linear scan.

3) Language-Specific Implementation:
• Very Pythonic: uses heapq for priority queue, list comprehensions, and a clean approach to storing “prev”. The code is concise and leverages standard Python idioms.   

4) Code Quality and Structure:
• Each problem is encapsulated in its own function. Readable variable names, docstrings, and consistent indentation.  
• The usage of “nonlocal” for count in N-Queens is Pythonic; some might prefer a class or a wrapped function scope, but it’s still clear.

5) Error Handling:
• Raises ValueError if vertices are out of bounds, which is good practice. Other functions handle edge conditions by returning early (e.g., empty strings in LCS). This is a solid approach in Python.

Grade: A

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
■■■ Rust Implementation ■■■
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness:
• N-Queens: Checks the column, upper-left, and upper-right diagonals thoroughly. Uses a backtrack function with proper references & mutations. Correctly updates the solution count and captures the first solution.  
• LCS: Constructs a 2D DP array; moves backward to collect matching characters and reverses them at the end. This logic is correct.  
• Dijkstra: Uses a BinaryHeap with a custom ordering (the State struct). Correctly updates distances and pushes new states into the heap. Reconstructs the path from the “prev” array by walking backward.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency:
• N-Queens: As typical, O(n!) worst case.  
• LCS: Typical O(m × n) time.  
• Dijkstra: A min-heap with O((E + V) log V) performance. This is the standard optimal approach for a sparse graph.

3) Language-Specific Implementation:
• Makes good use of ownership and borrowing rules, and the standard library’s BinaryHeap.  
• The code is idiomatic: uses slices, vectors, and patterns that Rust developers typically expect.

4) Code Quality and Structure:
• The code is well-structured into multiple functions (e.g., backtrack, is_valid) in N-Queens, and separated concerns in Dijkstra. Names are descriptive.  
• Could add more robust error handling (e.g., using Results more frequently in N-Queens or LCS), but overall it is neatly organized.

5) Error Handling:
• Returns Result for graph methods that may fail (invalid vertex). N-Queens and LCS simply rely on input correctness. For many Rust use cases, this is acceptable. Error messages are returned as Strings.

Grade: A

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
■■■ C Implementation ■■■
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness:
• N-Queens: Standard backtracking with column and diagonal checks. The code chooses to store only the first solution while accumulating a global count—this is valid.  
• LCS: The dynamic programming table is built and then traced from the bottom-right to find the subsequence. This handles edge cases, though the function returns dp[m][n] only after reconstructing the LCS in place.  
• Dijkstra: Works correctly using an adjacency list and a linear scan to find the min-distance vertex. The path is reconstructed by storing the “prev” array, reversing at the end.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency:
• N-Queens: The backtracking solution is the same O(n!) approach.  
• LCS: Fills a 2D table of size (m+1) × (n+1). Complexity is O(m × n).  
• Dijkstra: Uses a linear minDistance scan, resulting in O(V² + E) time if visited fully. This is acceptable but not as efficient as a min-heap approach.

3) Language-Specific Implementation:
• Classic C style with pointers, structs for adjacency lists, and manual memory management. Clear separation of concerns (creation of nodes, graph, Dijkstra logic).  
• Error messages are printed via fprintf, and manual freeing of memory is done. It’s quite typical C code.

4) Code Quality and Structure:
• Variable naming is generally clear (dist, visited, prev). The adjacency list structure is standard.  
• Some repeated code for reversing the path manually, but it’s neatly done. The code is fairly verbose, which is expected in C.

5) Error Handling:
• Prints errors for invalid vertices or memory allocation issues, then proceeds or exits. For demonstration code this is fine, though in production, more robust handling might be advisable. Freed memory at the end is good practice.

Grade: B+

## Graded by: o3-mini-high

Below is a detailed evaluation for each algorithm’s implementations in TypeScript, Python, Rust, and C. In what follows, I explain how each version fares with respect to correctness, efficiency, language idioms, code organization, and error/edge‐case handling.

────────────────────────────
1. N‐Queens Problem

• TypeScript  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The backtracking routine is implemented correctly. For every row the code tests the column and both diagonals before placing a queen. It properly counts solutions and saves the first valid board.  
 – Efficiency: The method uses simple backtracking (exponential in n), which is standard for N‑Queens. Nothing “clever” is attempted, but for moderate n it is acceptable.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: Use of array.fill combined with map is idiomatic TypeScript. The use of closures (inner helper functions) fits the style.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The functions are clearly organized and variables are well named; the code is readable and straightforward.  
 – Error Handling: There is no explicit check for invalid n (for example, n = 0 or negative values) but that isn’t critical in a sample implementation.

• Python  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The recursive backtracking correctly checks the column and both diagonals and makes a copy of the first solution.  
 – Efficiency: The backtracking is implemented in the typical O(n!) style. Although no advanced pruning is used, it is acceptable for educational purposes.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: It makes good use of list comprehensions and inner functions with nonlocal variables. The approach is clear and idiomatic Python.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The code is clean, modular, and variable names are descriptive.  
 – Error Handling: Similar to TypeScript, edge cases (such as n < 1) are not explicitly handled—but that is acceptable in a sample.

• Rust  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The backtracking logic is correctly implemented. It uses recursion and an “is_valid” helper to check for conflicts.  
 – Efficiency: Backtracking is implemented in the standard way. Although using Vec<Vec<String>> for the board adds some overhead compared to a lower‐level representation (e.g. booleans or bit masks), it remains correct for demonstration.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: The code leverages Rust’s safety (with proper bounds via usize) and cloning is used to capture the first solution. The style is conventional though the board representation could be improved for efficiency.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The functions are well separated and variable names descriptive. Overall structure is clean.  
 – Error Handling: There are no explicit checks for bad input, but that is common for such examples.

• C  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The implementation uses fixed-size 8×8 arrays and correctly backtracks over rows and columns. (It is correct for the classic 8‑Queens, though not defined for n other than 8.)  
 – Efficiency: The algorithm is standard backtracking; performance is acceptable for n = 8.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: The code is organized into helper functions (isValid, backtrack, printBoard) and uses plain loops. It’s typical C style using static arrays rather than dynamic allocation for the board, which keeps the code simple but not generalized.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The code is modular and clearly commented. Variable and function names are clear.  
 – Error Handling: There is minimal error checking (for example, no checks on n beyond the fixed size) and no dynamic allocation concerns here.

────────────────────────────
2. Longest Common Subsequence

• TypeScript  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: Using a dynamic programming table, the algorithm correctly computes the LCS length and then reconstructs the subsequence.  
 – Efficiency: Time and space complexities are O(m·n) which is optimal for classic LCS.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: Use of multidimensional arrays via map and a simple while‑loop for reconstruction is idiomatic.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The code is clearly laid out with descriptive names and well‐commented steps.  
 – Error Handling: An early check returns {0, ""} for empty inputs, which is adequate.

• Python  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The DP table and traceback are implemented correctly, and the final LCS is built as expected.  
 – Efficiency: The O(m·n) dynamic programming approach is standard and acceptable.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: The use of list comprehensions and nonlocal variables as needed is idiomatic Python.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: Code is well commented and structured in a readable style with clear variable names.  
 – Error Handling: The empty‑string check is a nice touch, though other corner cases aren’t explicitly guarded – which is generally fine in a demo.

• Rust  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The implementation correctly builds the DP table and reconstructs the LCS by iterating from the end of both strings.  
 – Efficiency: It maintains O(m·n) time and space complexity.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: Converting strings to Vec<char> is common practice; the reconstruction process using a mutable vector is idiomatic Rust.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: It is well structured and clear; comments help explain each part.  
 – Error Handling: The upfront check for empty strings is appropriate, and overall error concerns are minimal.

• C  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The DP table is dynamically allocated, filled correctly, and the LCS is reconstructed by back‑tracking through the table.  
 – Efficiency: Although the dynamic allocation (using int** and memset) is not “flashy,” O(m·n) performance is in line with expectations.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: The approach is standard for C; however, the manual memory management (allocation and free) always invites extra care.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The logic is clearly divided into the DP-filling and path–reconstruction parts. Comments help overall clarity.  
 – Error Handling: The implementation checks for NULL parameters and exits on memory allocation errors. Although more robust error handling could be added, it is sufficient for a sample.

────────────────────────────
3. Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm

• TypeScript  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The algorithm correctly initializes distances, relaxes edges, and reconstructs the path using a previous-pointer array.  
 – Efficiency: Instead of using a proper priority queue, the code scans an array (“queue”) to pick the minimum distance vertex – leading to O(V²) behavior. For small graphs this is acceptable but it isn’t optimal for larger ones.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: Using a class for Graph with an adjacency list (via a Map) is idiomatic in TypeScript.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The implementation is well organized, with clear methods for adding edges and running Dijkstra.  
 – Error Handling: The code checks that the source and destination are within bounds and throws errors where needed.

• Python  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The code implements Dijkstra’s algorithm correctly with proper distance updating and path reconstruction.  
 – Efficiency: By using heapq for the priority queue, the complexity is reduced to O((V+E) log V), which is a clear improvement over a naïve approach.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: Using heapq, defaultdict, and tuple-based PQ items is both idiomatic and efficient in Python.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The code is clearly structured, documented and the variable names are self-explanatory.  
 – Error Handling: It raises ValueError on out‑of-bound vertices and handles the situation where no path exists (returning an empty path and -1 for the distance).

• Rust  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The algorithm uses a BinaryHeap with a custom ordering to behave as a min‑heap. It relaxes edges and reconstructs the path correctly.  
 – Efficiency: This implementation uses efficient data structures (BinaryHeap) and compares states properly, ensuring near‑optimal performance.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: The use of custom Ord, Option, and Result for error conditions is fully idiomatic Rust.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The functions are well separated with clear naming and appropriate comments; error conditions are reported via Results.  
 – Error Handling: Source/destination validation is performed and errors are returned appropriately. Overall, the approach is robust.

• C  
 – Algorithmic Correctness: The implementation follows the classical Dijkstra’s algorithm by tracking distances, visited nodes, and previous pointers. The reconstruction of the path is handled correctly.  
 – Efficiency: A linear search in minDistance gives O(V²) performance – acceptable given the graph’s small size – though not optimal for larger datasets.  
 – Language‐Specific Implementation: The approach is typical C style – using arrays, helper functions, and manual reversal of the recovered path.  
 – Code Quality and Structure: The code is modularized into clear functions (minDistance, dijkstra, addEdge, freeGraph) and variable names are descriptive.  
 – Error Handling: There are checks for invalid vertices and error messages are printed if invalid data is provided. Memory is allocated and freed correctly, although many details (as with any C code) are “low level.”

────────────────────────────
Overall Assessment

All implementations solve their respective problems without major logical bugs. The use of recursion for N‑Queens and dynamic programming for LCS are standard and correct in every language. Dijkstra’s algorithm is implemented in a correct way; however, the TypeScript and C versions use linear scanning (instead of more optimal priority queues) which makes them less efficient for large graphs. The code in each language is recognizable and idiomatic—for instance, leveraging heapq in Python and BinaryHeap in Rust—yet some implementations (particularly in C) are specialized (fixed-size board or linear-minimum search) and could be further generalized or optimized. Error handling is present in many cases (especially validation of vertices in the graph problems and memory checks in C), though some edge cases (for example, nonpositive n for the N‑Queens problem) could be better managed.

Taking into account the overall design, correctness, clarity, and the minor inefficiencies or limitations noted in some language versions, the implementations demonstrate strong competence across all languages with only a few slight opportunities for improvement.

### TypeScript

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
All implementations correctly solve their respective problems. The N-Queens backtracking logic handles all valid placements, LCS dynamic programming is accurate, and Dijkstra’s produces correct shortest paths.  

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
- **N-Queens**: Optimal backtracking (O(N!)).  
- **LCS**: Standard DP with O(mn) time/space.  
- **Dijkstra**: Uses array-based min-search (O(V²)), which is suboptimal for large graphs. A priority queue (O((E+V) log V)) would enhance scalability.  

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Idiomatic TypeScript with classes and array methods. Missing heap usage for Dijkstra’s in a language where priority queues can be simulated.  

**Code Quality**: Clean and well-structured with appropriate JSDoc. Variable names are descriptive.  

**Error Handling**: Checks for invalid vertices in Dijkstra’s but lacks input validation for n ≤ 0 in N-Queens (e.g., n = 0).  

**Grade**: A-  

---

### Python

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
All correct. N-Queens deep-copies the first solution, LCS DP and Dijkstra’s with priority queue work as expected.  

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
**Optimal** in all cases. Dijkstra’s uses `heapq` for O((E+V) log V) time.  

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Pythonic with list comprehensions, `heapq`, and clean recursion.  

**Code Quality**: Readable and concise. Uses `nonlocal` appropriately in N-Queens.  

**Error Handling**: Raises `ValueError` for invalid vertices. No edge cases missed.  

**Grade**: A+  

---

### Rust

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
Correct for all problems. N-Queens leverages backtracking, LCS uses reverse iteration for reconstruction, and Dijkstra’s uses binary heap.  

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
Mostly optimal. N-Queens checks diagonals efficiently. Dijkstra’s uses heap. **Improvement**: Adjacency list should use `Vec<Vec<..>>` instead of `HashMap` for better cache locality.  

**Language-Specific Implementation**: Mostly idiomatic, but `HashMap` for adjacency lists is suboptimal. Error handling with `Result` and `unwrap` is appropriate.  

**Code Quality**: Clean structure with `State` ordering for heap. Some casts (`as isize`) in N-Queens are safe due to loop guards.  

**Error Handling**: Handles invalid vertices via `Result`.  

**Grade**: A  

---

### C

**Algorithmic Correctness**:  
- **N-Queens**: **Critical Bug**: Fixed-size 8×8 board causes buffer overflow for n > 8.  
- **LCS and Dijkstra’s**: Correct but lacks robustness checks (e.g., memory allocation failures).  

**Algorithmic Efficiency**:  
- **Dijkstra**: Correct O(V²) but optimizable with heaps.  
- **LCS**: Efficient DP reversal.  

**Language-Specific Implementation**:  
Idiomatic for C with adjacency lists and manual memory handling. **N-Queens’ fixed array** is a severe anti-pattern.  

**Code Quality**: Readable with modular functions. **N-Queens** logic is error-prone and not generalizable.  

**Error Handling**: No checks for n > 8 in N-Queens. Memory allocations lack error checking.  

**Grade**: C

**Letter Grade:** C
**Numeric Grade:** 2.0
