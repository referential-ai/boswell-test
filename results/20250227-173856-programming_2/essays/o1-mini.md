Certainly! Below are the complete implementations of the three algorithmic problems—**N-Queens Problem**, **Longest Common Subsequence**, and **Graph Traversal (Dijkstra's Algorithm)**—in **TypeScript**, **Python**, **Rust**, and **C**. Each implementation includes necessary imports, data structures, error handling, and comments explaining the approach.

## **TypeScript Implementations**

### 1) N-Queens Problem

```typescript
// N-Queens Problem in TypeScript
// Places 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard with no two queens threatening each other
// Uses backtracking to find all valid solutions and prints one valid solution

function solveNQueens(n: number): { count: number; oneSolution: number[] } {
    const solutions: number[][] = [];
    const positions: number[] = [];

    const isSafe = (row: number, col: number): boolean => {
        for (let i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            const placedCol = positions[i];
            if (placedCol === col || Math.abs(placedCol - col) === row - i) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    const backtrack = (row: number) => {
        if (row === n) {
            solutions.push([...positions]);
            return;
        }
        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (isSafe(row, col)) {
                positions[row] = col;
                backtrack(row + 1);
            }
        }
    };

    backtrack(0);
    const count = solutions.length;
    const oneSolutionArr = solutions[0] || [];
    return { count, oneSolution: oneSolutionArr };
}

// Example usage
const n = 8;
const result = solveNQueens(n);
console.log(`Total solutions for ${n}-Queens: ${result.count}`);
console.log('One valid solution (row: column):');
result.oneSolution.forEach((col, row) => {
    console.log(`${row}: ${col}`);
});
```

### 2) Longest Common Subsequence

```typescript
// Longest Common Subsequence in TypeScript
// Finds the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming

function longestCommonSubsequence(a: string, b: string): { length: number; subsequence: string } {
    const m = a.length;
    const n = b.length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    // Build the dp table
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (a[i - 1] === b[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Reconstruct the subsequence
    let i = m, j = n;
    let subsequence = '';
    while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
        if (a[i - 1] === b[j - 1]) {
            subsequence = a[i - 1] + subsequence;
            i--;
            j--;
        } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
            i--;
        } else {
            j--;
        }
    }

    return { length: dp[m][n], subsequence };
}

// Example usage
const str1 = "ABCBDAB";
const str2 = "BDCABA";
const lcsResult = longestCommonSubsequence(str1, str2);
console.log(`LCS Length: ${lcsResult.length}`);
console.log(`LCS: ${lcsResult.subsequence}`);
```

### 3) Graph Traversal - Dijkstra's Algorithm

```typescript
// Dijkstra's Algorithm in TypeScript
// Finds the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph represented as an adjacency list

type Edge = { vertex: number; weight: number };
type Graph = Edge[][];

function dijkstra(graph: Graph, start: number, end: number): { path: number[]; totalWeight: number } | null {
    const n = graph.length;
    const distances = Array(n).fill(Infinity);
    const prev = Array<number | null>(n).fill(null);
    distances[start] = 0;

    const visited = Array(n).fill(false);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Find the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance
        let u = -1;
        for (let v = 0; v < n; v++) {
            if (!visited[v] && (u === -1 || distances[v] < distances[u])) {
                u = v;
            }
        }

        if (distances[u] === Infinity) break;
        visited[u] = true;

        for (const edge of graph[u]) {
            const { vertex, weight } = edge;
            if (distances[u] + weight < distances[vertex]) {
                distances[vertex] = distances[u] + weight;
                prev[vertex] = u;
            }
        }
    }

    if (distances[end] === Infinity) return null;

    // Reconstruct the path
    const path: number[] = [];
    let at: number | null = end;
    while (at !== null) {
        path.unshift(at);
        at = prev[at];
    }

    return { path, totalWeight: distances[end] };
}

// Sample graph with 6 vertices
const sampleGraph: Graph = [
    // Vertex 0
    [{ vertex: 1, weight: 7 }, { vertex: 2, weight: 9 }, { vertex: 5, weight: 14 }],
    // Vertex 1
    [{ vertex: 0, weight: 7 }, { vertex: 2, weight: 10 }, { vertex: 3, weight: 15 }],
    // Vertex 2
    [{ vertex: 0, weight: 9 }, { vertex: 1, weight: 10 }, { vertex: 3, weight: 11 }, { vertex: 5, weight: 2 }],
    // Vertex 3
    [{ vertex: 1, weight: 15 }, { vertex: 2, weight: 11 }, { vertex: 4, weight: 6 }],
    // Vertex 4
    [{ vertex: 3, weight: 6 }, { vertex: 5, weight: 9 }],
    // Vertex 5
    [{ vertex: 0, weight: 14 }, { vertex: 2, weight: 2 }, { vertex: 4, weight: 9 }]
];

// Example usage
const startVertex = 0;
const endVertex = 4;
const dijkstraResult = dijkstra(sampleGraph, startVertex, endVertex);
if (dijkstraResult) {
    console.log(`Shortest path from ${startVertex} to ${endVertex}: ${dijkstraResult.path.join(' -> ')}`);
    console.log(`Total weight: ${dijkstraResult.totalWeight}`);
} else {

# Grading Feedback

## Graded by: Llama-3-8B

Here are the detailed critiques for each language implementation:

**TypeScript Implementations**

### 1) N-Queens Problem

The TypeScript implementation of the N-Queens problem is generally correct and well-organized. The `isSafe` function correctly checks if a queen can be placed at a given position without threatening any other queens. The `backtrack` function effectively explores all possible solutions. However, the use of a global array `positions` might make the function less readable and harder to maintain. A better approach would be to use a recursive function that takes the current row number as an argument.

Correctness: 9/10
Efficiency: 8/10 (the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n!), which is not the most efficient)
Language-specific implementation: 9/10 (the use of TypeScript features like interfaces and type annotations is good, but the code could be more concise)
Code quality and structure: 8/10 (the code is generally well-organized, but some functions are quite long and could be broken down into smaller ones)
Error handling: 9/10 (the code handles edge cases and potential errors correctly)

Grade: A-

### 2) Longest Common Subsequence

The TypeScript implementation of the Longest Common Subsequence problem is correct and well-optimized. The dynamic programming approach with a 2D array is effective in finding the longest common subsequence. The code is also well-organized and easy to read.

Correctness: 10/10
Efficiency: 9/10 (the algorithm has a time complexity of O(m \* n), which is relatively efficient)
Language-specific implementation: 9/10 (the use of TypeScript features like interfaces and type annotations is good, and the code is concise)
Code quality and structure: 9/10 (the code is well-organized and easy to read)
Error handling: 10/10 (the code handles edge cases and potential errors correctly)

Grade: A

### 3) Graph Traversal - Dijkstra's Algorithm

The TypeScript implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is correct and well-organized. The code uses a priority queue to efficiently select the next node to visit, and the algorithm correctly computes the shortest path. However, the code could be improved by using a more descriptive variable name instead of `dp` and by adding more comments to explain the algorithm.

Correctness: 10/10
Efficiency: 9/10 (the algorithm has a time complexity of O(E + V log V), which is relatively efficient)
Language-specific implementation: 9/10 (the use of TypeScript features like interfaces and type annotations is good, and the code is concise)
Code quality and structure: 8/10 (the code is generally well-organized, but some functions are quite long and could be broken down into smaller ones)
Error handling: 9/10 (the code handles edge cases and potential errors correctly)

Correctness: 8/10
Efficiency: 7/10 (the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n!), which is not the most efficient)
Language-specific implementation: 6/10 (the code uses Python features, but the formatting and readability could be improved)

**C Implementations**

Please note that the provided C code is limited, and the criticisms are based on what is given.

### 3) Graph Traversal - Dijkstra's Algorithm

The C implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is generally correct, but it has some issues with formatting and readability. The use of global variables and the `free` function without proper handling of errors are potential issues.

Correctness: 9/10
Efficiency: 8/10 (the algorithm has a time complexity of O(E + V log V), which is relatively efficient)
Language-specific implementation: 7/10 (the code uses C features, but the formatting and readability could be improved)
Code quality and structure: 7/10 (the code is generally well-organized, but some functions are quite long and could be broken down into smaller ones)
Error handling: 7/10 (the code handles edge cases and potential errors correctly)

Grade: B

In general, the TypeScript implementations are the strongest, with good correctness, efficiency, language-specific implementation, code quality, and error handling. The Python implementation has some issues with formatting and readability, while the C implementation has some issues with global variables and proper error handling.

- Could optimize by using a more efficient data structure for checking diagonal conflicts.

```
Grade: A-
```

### 2. Longest Common Subsequence

This implementation follows the standard dynamic programming approach for LCS.

**Strengths:**
- Clean implementation of the DP solution with proper 2D array initialization.
- Efficient subsequence reconstruction.
- Good use of TypeScript interfaces for return values.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No input validation for empty strings.
- The space complexity is O(m*n), but it could be optimized to O(min(m,n)) with a rolling array.
- Variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., 'a' and 'b' could be 'string1' and 'string2').

```
Grade: A
```

### 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Strengths:**
- Well-defined types for Graph and Edge.
- The code correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
- The path reconstruction is properly implemented.

**Weaknesses:**
- The implementation uses a linear search to find the minimum distance vertex, which is O(n²) time complexity. A priority queue would be more efficient (O(n log n)).
- No validation for input graph connectivity or negative edge weights.
- The example graph is hard-coded rather than being a parameter.

```
Grade: B
```

## Python Implementations

### 1. N-Queens Problem

**Strengths:**
- Idiomatic Python implementation with well-structured functions.
- Good use of Python's list comprehension and copy methods.
- The backtracking algorithm is correctly implemented.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The implementation doesn't handle the edge case where n is too small for a solution to exist.
- The `positions` list grows and shrinks with backtracking, which is slightly less efficient than using a fixed-size array with an index.
- Type hints are used inconsistently - they're present for function parameters but not for return values.

```
Grade: A-
```

### 2. Longest Common Subsequence

**Strengths:**
- Follows the standard dynamic programming approach.
- Efficient subsequence reconstruction.
- Good use of type hints.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Missing input validation for empty strings.
- Rebuilding the subsequence in reversed order then reversing it again is unnecessary - could build it in the correct order from the start.
- The code doesn't leverage Python's more idiomatic `enumerate()` for iteration in the reconstruction phase.

```
Grade: A-
```

### 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Strengths:**
- Uses a priority queue (via heapq) for efficient minimum distance vertex selection.
- Type hints improve code readability and maintainability.
- Good optimization by stopping early when the end vertex is reached.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The heap implementation doesn't handle updating priorities properly - it adds duplicate entries for vertices, which is inefficient.
- There's no validation for negative edge weights, which would break Dijkstra's algorithm.
- The graph representation is a bit unusual (v, weight) rather than standard (v, w) which might be confusing.

```
Grade: B+
```

## Rust Implementations

### 1. N-Queens Problem

**Strengths:**
- Efficient implementation using Rust's ownership system.
- Properly uses iterators and references for efficiency.
- The algorithm is correctly implemented.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The `is_safe` function could be implemented more efficiently using Rust's iterators instead of a for loop.
- Missing error handling for cases where `n` is too small to have a solution.
- The `abs` conversion between `isize` and `usize` is a bit verbose and could be streamlined.

```
Grade: A
```

### 2. Longest Common Subsequence

**Strengths:**
- Idiomatic Rust implementation with proper memory management.
- Efficient use of Rust's vector operations.
- Clear separation of string analysis and DP table construction.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Pre-collecting the characters into vectors isn't strictly necessary - could iterate over the strings directly.
- The indexing (`i-1` and `j-1`) is a bit error-prone and could be simplified.
- No input validation for empty strings.

```
Grade: A
```

### 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Strengths:**
- Excellent use of Rust's type system and traits.
- Properly implements a priority queue with correct ordering for Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Efficient implementation with early stopping when the destination is reached.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The Edge type uses a tuple which is less descriptive than a struct would be.
- Missing validation for negative edge weights.
- The reconstruction of the path could be more efficient by pre-allocating based on the known path length.

```
Grade: A
```

## C Implementations

### 1. N-Queens Problem

**Strengths:**
- Efficient implementation using arrays for position tracking.
- The backtracking algorithm is correctly implemented.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Uses global variables (`solutions_count` and `one_solution`), which is not ideal for encapsulation.
- Fixed size for `N` (8) rather than a parameterizable function.
- No error handling for failed memory allocations.

```
Grade: B
```

### 2. Longest Common Subsequence

**Strengths:**
- Correctly implements the standard DP approach for LCS.
- Properly manages memory allocation and deallocation.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Potential buffer overflow in `subseq` - there's no validation that the buffer is large enough.
- Error handling for memory allocation failures is missing.
- The code could be more modular - the reconstruction logic could be separated from the main function.

```
Grade: B-
```

### 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Strengths:**
- Implements a min-heap for efficiently finding the minimum distance vertex.
- Contains proper memory management with allocation and deallocation.
- Correct implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm with path reconstruction.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The adjacency list implementation is complex and error-prone.
- Potential memory leaks exist if early returns happen before the cleanup code.
- Fixed vertex count (`V`) rather than a parameter, limiting flexibility.
- The heap operations could be more efficient with better swap operations.

```
Grade: B-
```

## Overall Assessment

- **TypeScript**: Generally well-structured with good use of types, but some inefficiencies in the Dijkstra implementation.
- **Python**: Clean, idiomatic implementations, though with some room for optimization and more consistent type usage.
- **Rust**: Excellent use of Rust's type system and ownership model, with safe and efficient implementations.
- **C**: Functional but with concerns about memory safety, global variables, and lack of parameterization.

For large scale production use, the Rust implementations would be the most reliable and efficient, followed closely by the TypeScript and Python implementations. The C implementations, while potentially fast, would require significant hardening for safety and flexibility.

*   **Code Quality and Structure:** Complex, but standard for C. The need to manually manage memory and implement the heap makes the code significantly more verbose.
*   **Error Handling:** Does not provide edge/error conditions appropriately, relies on dest + 1 being within bounds. Memory is freed at the end.

# Comprehensive Algorithm Implementation Evaluation

## N-Queens Problem

### TypeScript Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** The implementation correctly uses backtracking to find all valid solutions for the N-Queens problem. The `isSafe` function properly checks diagonal and column conflicts.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Time complexity is O(N!), which is expected for this combinatorial problem. Space complexity is O(N²) for storing all solutions. The algorithm is efficient for the problem domain.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** The code leverages TypeScript's type system well with appropriate return type annotations. It uses modern JavaScript features like array spread operator for copying positions. 

**Code Quality and Structure:** The code is well-structured with clear function names. The solution is broken down into logical functions (backtracking and safety checking).

**Error Handling:** The implementation doesn't validate that `n` is a positive integer. It handles the case of no solutions by returning an empty array, but this is not explicitly documented.

```
Grade: A-
```

### Python Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** The solution correctly implements backtracking and safety checks. Unlike the TypeScript version, it appropriately uses `positions.pop()` after backtracking.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Time complexity is O(N!) and space complexity is O(N²), which are appropriate for this problem.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Uses Python idioms well, including list comprehensions and type hints. The nested function approach is clean and Pythonic.

**Code Quality and Structure:** The code is very readable with clear variable names and logical structure.

**Error Handling:** The implementation doesn't validate the input `n`. It handles the case of empty solutions with a conditional expression, but doesn't document edge cases.

```
Grade: A-
```

### Rust Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** Correctly implements the N-Queens algorithm with proper backtracking and safety checks.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Time complexity is O(N!), space complexity is O(N²), which are appropriate.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Uses Rust's type system effectively with appropriate use of references, borrowing, and the `usize` type for array indices. The `clone()` method is used correctly for copying data.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Well-structured with clear function names and purpose. The code follows Rust conventions.

**Error Handling:** Uses `usize` which prevents negative inputs. Properly handles the case of no solutions by returning an empty vector.

```
Grade: A
```

### C Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** The implementation correctly solves the N-Queens problem.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Time complexity is O(N!), which is expected. Space complexity is O(N), as it only stores one solution rather than all solutions.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Uses C's procedural style effectively, but relies on global variables which is not ideal.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Functions have clear names and focus, but the use of globals reduces modularity.

**Error Handling:** The board size is hardcoded to 8, limiting flexibility. No input validation is performed.

```
Grade: B
```

## Longest Common Subsequence

### TypeScript Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** Correctly implements LCS using the standard dynamic programming approach. Both the DP table building and subsequence reconstruction are implemented correctly.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Time and space complexity are both O(m*n), which is optimal for this problem.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Uses TypeScript's type system well. The code uses modern JavaScript features like `Array.from()` with a mapping function.

**Code Quality and Structure:** The code is clean and clearly structured with descriptive variable names.

**Error Handling:** The code doesn't explicitly check for empty strings or non-string inputs, but the algorithm itself handles empty strings correctly.

```
Grade: A
```

### Python Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** The implementation correctly builds the DP table and reconstructs the subsequence.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Time and space complexity are both O(m*n), which is optimal.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Uses Python idioms like list comprehensions for matrix creation and multiple assignment. The use of `reversed()` with `join()` for the subsequence reconstruction is elegant.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Very clean and readable code with a logical flow.

**Error Handling:** No explicit handling of edge cases, though the algorithm naturally handles empty strings.

```
Grade: A
```

### Rust Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** Correctly implements LCS with proper DP table construction and subsequence reconstruction.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** The O(m*n) time and space complexity are optimal, but the conversion of strings to character vectors adds a small overhead.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Good use of Rust's type system and collection methods. The code correctly handles Unicode by using char vectors.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Well-organized with clear variable names, though there are some minor spacing inconsistencies (e.g., `i -=1` versus `i -= 1`).

**Error Handling:** The implementation implicitly handles empty strings correctly but doesn't explicitly check inputs.

```
Grade: A-
```

### C Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements LCS.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Time and space complexity are O(m*n), which is optimal.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Appropriately uses C's manual memory management and pointer operations.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Code is reasonably well-structured with descriptive variable names.

**Error Handling:** Does not check if memory allocation succeeds, which could lead to segmentation faults. Also doesn't verify if the caller-provided buffer is large enough for the result.

```
Grade: B+
```

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

### TypeScript Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** The implementation has O(V²) time complexity because it doesn't use a priority queue, which is suboptimal compared to O((V+E)log V) possible with a min-heap.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Uses appropriate TypeScript types. The graph representation using custom Edge type is clear.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Well-organized with descriptive variable names.

**Error Handling:** Returns null when no path exists, but doesn't validate graph inputs or check if vertices are within bounds.

```
Grade: B+
```

### Python Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Uses a heap for O((V+E)log V) time complexity, which is optimal.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Excellent use of Python's `heapq` module for the priority queue. Type hints add clarity.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Clean, well-structured code with a logical flow.

**Error Handling:** Returns None when no path exists, but doesn't validate input parameters.

```
Grade: A
```

### Rust Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** Correctly implements Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Achieves optimal O((V+E)log V) complexity using Rust's BinaryHeap.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Excellent use of Rust idioms, including custom implementations of Ord and PartialOrd for the priority queue, pattern matching, and the Option type for missing values.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Very well-organized with clear separation of concerns.

**Error Handling:** Uses Option for path absence and leverages Rust's type system for bounds checking.

```
Grade: A+
```

### C Implementation

**Algorithmic Correctness:** The algorithm correctly implements Dijkstra.

**Algorithmic Efficiency:** Achieves O((V+E)log V) with a custom min-heap implementation.

**Language-Specific Implementation:** Implements complex data structures manually, which is necessary in C.

**Code Quality and Structure:** Code is organized into functions, but the complexity makes it harder to read than the other implementations.

**Error Handling:** Has a potentially flawed assumption that `dest+1` equals the number of vertices. Doesn't check if memory allocations succeed.

```
Grade: B
```

## Overall Assessment and Conclusions

The Rust implementations generally show the best balance of correctness, efficiency, and language-specific idioms. The Python code follows closely with clean, idiomatic solutions. TypeScript implementations are generally good but sometimes miss optimizations. The C implementations, while functional, often lack robustness in error handling and rely on global state.

The most consistent issue across all implementations is insufficient input validation and error handling, which would be important in production code.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 TypeScript Implementations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness
• N-Queens: The backtracking logic (checking columns and diagonals using row and column differences) is correctly implemented. It finds all solutions and preserves one. Handling of the “isSafe” check is accurate.  
• LCS: Standard DP approach for computing the length and reconstructing the subsequence. Correctly checks matching characters and builds the subsequence in reverse.  
• Dijkstra: Uses an O(n²) approach to find the vertex with minimum distance in each iteration, which is fine for smaller graphs. The reconstruction of the path via the "prev" array is also correct.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency
• N-Queens: Backtracking is the accepted approach. Time complexity is O(n!), which is expected for this problem.  
• LCS: The DP solution is O(m×n) in time and space, which is optimal for classic LCS.  
• Dijkstra: The implementation uses a linear search for the closest vertex (no priority queue), resulting in O(V² + E) complexity. For large graphs, this is less efficient than a typical binary heap or priority queue version.

3) Language-Specific Implementation
• Good use of TypeScript’s type annotations (e.g., "type Graph = Edge[][]").  
• The code is reasonably idiomatic. Helper functions ("isSafe", for instance) are well-structured.  
• Could consider using more robust type definitions for graph edges, possibly an interface over a plain object type.

4) Code Quality and Structure
• Reasonably organized. Each function (solveNQueens, longestCommonSubsequence, dijkstra) has a clear purpose.  
• Naming is clear and descriptive.  
• The code is easy to follow overall.

5) Error Handling
• There is no explicit error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative n in N-Queens, out-of-range start/end in Dijkstra).  
• For typical use, the code runs without issues. For real-world usage, you might add checks on input validity.

Grade: A-

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Python Implementations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness
• N-Queens: Standard backtracking is implemented correctly. The code collects all solutions and returns the count plus one example.  
• LCS: Uses a well-known 2D DP approach and correctly reconstructs the subsequence from the bottom-right corner.  
• Dijkstra: Uses heapq for a proper O((V+E)logV) priority-queue-based implementation, which is correct and efficient.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency
• N-Queens: Same typical backtracking complexity, O(n!).  
• LCS: O(m×n) time, O(m×n) space—solid.  
• Dijkstra: Efficient approach with a min-heap, which is optimal for standard Dijkstra.

3) Language-Specific Implementation
• The code is quite Pythonic: list comprehensions, use of heapq, and straightforward function definitions.  
• Typing is partially used (typing.List, etc.), though some type hints could be more complete. Still, this is typical Python style.

4) Code Quality and Structure
• Code is short, well-commented, and readable.  
• Functions and variables are named appropriately.  
• The structure is easy to maintain.

5) Error Handling
• Minimal checks on input parameters, but for demonstrative scripts, this is acceptable.  
• The code uses standard Python patterns (e.g., returning None if no path in Dijkstra).

Grade: A

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Rust Implementations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness
• N-Queens: Correctly checks for diagonal and column conflicts. Positions are pushed and popped in backtracking.  
• LCS: Standard DP approach. Correct reconstruction in reverse, then reversed at the end to get the subsequence.  
• Dijkstra: Uses a BinaryHeap with a custom State struct for (cost, vertex), which is the typical approach in Rust. The path reconstruction is also correct.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency
• N-Queens: Standard O(n!) backtracking.  
• LCS: O(m×n) in time.  
• Dijkstra: Priority queue approach using the standard library’s BinaryHeap, achieving O((V+E)logV) in typical usage.

3) Language-Specific Implementation
• Fairly idiomatic Rust: uses slices, vectors, and pattern matching.  
• Some small improvements could be made (e.g., more functional iteration or returning Results for error cases), but overall solid.

4) Code Quality and Structure
• Modules are not separated, but each function is neatly contained with comments.  
• The code is reasonably well-structured and easy to read for Rust code. Variable and function names are descriptive.

5) Error Handling
• Little in the way of robust error handling, mostly returning None for "no path."  
• Generally fine for demonstration code; a production version might prefer more explicit results or advanced error handling.

Grade: A

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 C Implementations
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Algorithmic Correctness
• N-Queens: Uses a global solutions_count and an array to store one solution. This works for small N, though it’s less modular than the other languages’ approaches.  
• LCS: Standard DP approach in C with a 2D array, reconstructs the subsequence by tracing from dp[m][n] backward. This is correct.  
• Dijkstra: Manually implements a min-heap with adjacency list. The logic is essentially correct for minimum distances. Reconstructs the path using “prev” array.

2) Algorithmic Efficiency
• N-Queens: Same O(n!) approach.  
• LCS: O(m×n) DP.  
• Dijkstra: The min-heap approach runs in O((V+E)logV) if used properly, but the code’s approach to “V = dest + 1” is slightly odd if “end_vertex” is not the max index. You’d typically want V to be a known constant or the entire graph size. Still, for the sample, it works.

3) Language-Specific Implementation
• Uses raw pointers, manual memory allocation, and frees data in Dijkstra. Reasonable for a demonstration.  
• The adjacency list is built with linked lists. This is a common C pattern, but can be prone to memory errors if not used carefully.

4) Code Quality and Structure
• Some naming could be clearer (e.g., “crawl” for the edge pointer).  
• The code is more verbose, typical of C. The min-heap code is fairly lengthy.  
• The in-function definition of “int V = dest + 1;” might cause confusion if the user picks a different “dest.” Usually one would define V as the total number of vertices in the graph.

5) Error Handling
• Very little error checking for invalid input or out-of-bounds usage.  
• Freed memory is handled for edges and the heap, though thorough testing would be ideal to ensure no leaks or use-after-free.

Below is a language‐by‐language evaluation of the three algorithms. Overall, the implementations demonstrate good familiarity with each language’s idioms and sound algorithmic ideas. However, while the TypeScript, Python, and Rust implementations are solid both in clarity and correctness—with only minor inefficiencies (for example, the TypeScript version of Dijkstra’s uses a linear scan instead of a true priority queue)—the C implementations are more “bare‐bones.” In particular, the C version of Dijkstra’s algorithm has a significant issue with how the min‐heap is initialized and maintained, which can lead to undefined behavior when checking “is_in_min_heap” on vertices that were never inserted. There is also limited defensive programming (for example, checking malloc returns) in the C code. With that in mind, here is a detailed breakdown:

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
TypeScript

1) N‑Queens Problem  
 • Correctness & Edge Cases: The backtracking solution correctly places queens and collects all solutions. It properly tests for conflicts diagonally and in the same column.  
 • Efficiency: The algorithm is O(n!) as expected; the solution–collecting approach works well for an 8×8 board.  
 • Language‐specific Implementation: It makes good use of closures (local helper functions) and strong typing.  
 • Code Quality: The code is modular and readable; naming is clear (“positions,” “isSafe,” etc.).  
 • Error Handling: There isn’t explicit handling of bogus input (for example, n <= 0), but that’s acceptable in this educational example.

2) Longest Common Subsequence  
 • Correctness: The dynamic programming approach (constructing dp and then backtracking) is implemented correctly.  
 • Efficiency: Time and space are O(m·n), which is standard; no unnecessary work is found.  
 • Language Idioms: The code leverages TypeScript’s array utilities cleanly.  
 • Structure & Readability: Clear variable names and step–by–step reconstruction help understanding.  
 • Error Handling: It gracefully handles empty strings.

3) Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
 • Correctness: The algorithm finds the shortest path as intended and returns null if unreachable.  
 • Efficiency: It uses an O(V)-per–iteration scan to select the next vertex; while a binary heap would improve performance, the trade–off is acceptable for small examples.  
 • Language–specific: The use of simple loops and objects fits well with TypeScript’s style.  
 • Code Quality: The separation into clearly named variables (distances, visited, prev) makes the logic easy to follow.  
 • Error Handling: Edge cases (such as unreachable vertices) are well handled.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Python

1) N‑Queens Problem  
 • Correctness: The recursive backtracking properly copies and pops positions and collects solutions.  
 • Efficiency: Standard O(n!) runtime is acceptable, and the code avoids unnecessary copying except when recording solutions.  
 • Language–specific Idioms: The use of list methods like append and pop is idiomatic.  
 • Code Quality: Clear naming and inline comments make the implementation easy to understand.  
 • Error Handling: While no explicit input validation is provided, the algorithm works fine for the intended domain.

2) Longest Common Subsequence  
 • Correctness: The dp table is built and then used to reconstruct the LCS accurately.  
 • Efficiency: The O(m·n) solution is standard and well implemented.  
 • Language–specific: List comprehensions and the use of reversed() in the reconstruction are idiomatic.  
 • Structure: Code is clear, with meaningful variable names.  
 • Error Handling: Edge cases (empty strings) are implicitly handled via the dp array dimensions.

3) Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
 • Correctness: The use of Python’s heapq priority queue is both efficient and correct in handling relaxations and avoiding revisits.  
 • Efficiency: The algorithm runs in O((V+E) log V) time, which is optimal for this approach.  
 • Language–specific: The code leverages Python’s standard library (heapq) and type hints for clarity.  
 • Code Quality: Well–commented and modular; use of meaningful names (“heap,” “prev,” “distances”) adds readability.  
 • Error Handling: It properly returns None when no path is found.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Rust

1) N‑Queens Problem  
 • Correctness: The backtracking procedure is correctly implemented. The helper functions (is_safe and backtrack) work together to search all possibilities.  
 • Efficiency: It correctly uses recursion and cloning only when a solution is found.  
 • Language–specific: Although using helper functions defined at the outer level rather than closures might be seen as less “Rust–idiomatic” (some might prefer closures), it remains perfectly clear and safe.  
 • Code Quality: The clear separation of functionality, along with inline comments and proper use of Vec, contributes to excellent readability.  
 • Error Handling: The algorithm assumes well–formed input; given its educational purpose, this is acceptable.

2) Longest Common Subsequence  
 • Correctness: The dp table is built correctly, and subsequence reconstruction (with reversal) is handled well.  
 • Efficiency: The O(m·n) time and space complexity is standard and acceptable.  
 • Language–specific: Good utilization of Rust’s Vec and string manipulation methods.  
 • Code Quality: Variables and control flow are clear; the comments help explain the logic.  
 • Error Handling: Implicitly handles empty strings through the dp table initialization.

3) Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
 • Correctness: The algorithm uses a BinaryHeap with a custom “State” struct for a min–heap behavior. It correctly updates distances and reconstructs the path.  
 • Efficiency: With logarithmic heap operations, it meets the expected performance for Dijkstra’s algorithm.  
 • Language–specific: The implementation is idiomatic, using pattern matching and proper trait implementations for ordering.  
 • Code Quality: The code is well–structured, with clear variable names and inline commentary.  
 • Error Handling: It returns None for unreachable destinations and includes checks for outdated states.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
C

1) N‑Queens Problem  
 • Correctness: The recursive backtracking approach works correctly on an 8×8 board; storing the first found solution is handled via globals.  
 • Efficiency: The algorithm is written in a standard recursive style with no unnecessary overhead.  
 • Language–specific: The code follows typical C idioms, although reliance on global variables (solutions_count and one_solution) could be encapsulated better.  
 • Code Quality: Variable names and comments are clear, but better modularity (for example, encapsulating state in a structure) would improve maintainability.  
 • Error Handling: There’s no protection against invalid board sizes, but for the given constant this is not an issue.

2) Longest Common Subsequence  
 • Correctness: The dynamic programming table is correctly built and used to reconstruct the LCS.  
 • Efficiency: The approach uses O(m·n) time and allocates a 2D array dynamically, which is typical in C.  
 • Language–specific: The use of malloc and free is natural for C programs.  
 • Code Quality: The code is relatively easy to follow; helper functions (like max) assist readability.  
 • Error Handling: There is no check for malloc failures, which would be advisable in production code.

3) Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
 • Correctness: This implementation attempts a full-featured solution (including a custom min–heap), but it falls short. The heap is initialized only with the source vertex, and the positions array for other vertices is never set. As a result, the function is_in_min_heap and decrease_key are applied under the assumption that every vertex is already in the heap. In standard Dijkstra’s implementations in C one either initializes the heap with all vertices or explicitly inserts new vertices upon relaxation. This flaw can lead to undefined behavior.  
 • Efficiency: The heap–based approach is appropriate, but a proper initialization would be needed to achieve O((V+E) log V) performance.  
 • Language–specific: The code uses structs and linked lists to represent the graph and heap structures in a conventional C style.  
 • Code Quality: The code is commented and clearly separates functions; however, more rigorous error checking (for memory allocation, for example) would improve robustness.  
 • Error Handling: Aside from the potential heap initialization bug, there are no checks for memory failures and no recovery paths for bad input.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Overall Assessment

Most implementations are well written, maintainable, and take advantage of their languages’ strengths. The TypeScript, Python, and Rust versions are solid educational examples with clear, idiomatic code and proper algorithm implementation. The C implementations correctly solve the N‑Queens and LCS problems and show familiarity with dynamic memory and pointer manipulation; however, the Dijkstra’s algorithm in C contains a significant design flaw in its use of the min–heap (failing to initialize entries for all vertices), and lacks comprehensive error handling for memory allocation.

Taking all languages into account—and when in doubt choosing the lower grade—the overall quality is very good, though the bug in C’s Dijkstra’s brings the rating slightly down.
