## Introduction to the Boswell Quotient
The Boswell Quotient is a comprehensive metric designed to evaluate LLM capabilities across multiple dimensions. Named after James Boswell, who was known for his deep understanding and insightful observations of Samuel Johnson, this quotient aims to measure how well an AI model can serve as an indispensable companion in academic and analytical tasks.

The Boswell Quotient (0-100) is calculated from three key components:
1. **Performance (33.3%)**: How well the model performs in generating content, based on grades received from peers
2. **Evaluation (33.3%)**: How accurately and consistently the model evaluates others' work
3. **Efficiency (33.3%)**: How quickly the model completes tasks

## Overall Model Rankings
