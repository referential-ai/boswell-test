# Navigating the Sovereignty-Governance Paradox in Global AI Policy

The emerging tension between national AI sovereignty and global governance frameworks represents one of the most consequential challenges in contemporary international relations. This tension manifests in fundamentally different approaches to AI regulation, reflecting divergent philosophical foundations, geopolitical aspirations, and conceptions of state power in the digital age.

## Philosophical Foundations of National AI Policies

The EU's AI Act represents a rights-based approach to AI governance, prioritizing individual dignity and autonomy. Its risk-based classification system reflects the European philosophical tradition of placing boundaries around technological development when it threatens fundamental rights. As the European Commission states in the Act's explanatory memorandum, it aims to develop an "ecosystem of trust" where AI systems comply with "European rules, including the protection of fundamental rights" (European Commission, 2021).

By contrast, China's 2021 AI Governance Principles and subsequent regulations reflect a utilitarian approach that prioritizes collective welfare and social harmony. The Chinese State Council's "New Generation AI Development Plan" (2017) envisions AI as serving "the construction of an intelligent society and protecting the public interest," reflecting Confucian traditions of social order and collective benefit. This philosophical divergence manifests in China's acceptance of surveillance technologies that would be prohibited under the EU's AI Act.

The U.S. approach, exemplified in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (White House OSTP, 2022) and the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI (2023), reflects American philosophical pragmatism with emphasis on innovation, limited government intervention, and risk management. The Executive Order specifically aims to "manage AI's risks while embracing its promise," reflecting the American tradition of technological optimism tempered by risk awareness.

## Global Implications and Technical Manifestations

These philosophical differences materialize in technical standards and protocols. Consider three critical examples:

**1. Facial recognition standards:** China's participation in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has led to proposals for facial recognition standards that emphasize operational efficiency over privacy safeguards, directly contradicting EU standards that require explicit consent and proportionality tests. This divergence creates a "standards war" in emerging markets, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, where Chinese vendors offer complete surveillance systems aligned with their technical standards (Gross et al., 2021).

**2. Data localization requirements:** China's Data Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law mandate local storage of critical data, reflecting digital sovereignty priorities. This directly conflicts with provisions in the U.S.-led Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, which promotes cross-border data flows. The technical infrastructure being built to comply with these contradictory requirements is creating a fragmented global data ecosystem, increasing compliance costs and limiting AI capabilities that depend on diverse training data (Chander & Anupam, 2022).

**3. AI safety testing protocols:** The EU's AI Act requires rigorous pre-deployment testing for high-risk systems, while the U.S. emphasizes industry self-regulation through voluntary frameworks like NIST's AI Risk Management Framework. Meanwhile, China's 2023 regulations mandate security assessments with explicit national security considerations. These divergent approaches create regulatory arbitrage opportunities but also significant uncertainty for global AI developers (Smuha, 2021).

## Future Scenarios

Two potential paths forward emerge:

**Scenario 1: Regulatory Divergence Acceleration**
If current trajectories continue, we may see the formation of distinct AI governance blocs with incompatible standards and protocols. This would likely manifest in export controls on AI technologies (already beginning with the U.S. CHIPS Act and subsequent Commerce Department regulations), mandatory code review requirements, and conflicting certification systems. This scenario risks creating a "splinternet" for AI, with negative implications for innovation and global challenges that require coordinated AI solutions, such as climate change and pandemic response.

**Scenario 2: Bounded Convergence**
A more optimistic scenario involves what Eyal Benvenisti (2023) calls "sovereignty-respecting interdependence." This would involve multilateral cooperation on clearly defined issues—like preventing AI-enabled biological weapons or establishing testing standards for generative AI systems—while allowing for regulatory diversity in more culturally embedded domains like permissible surveillance applications or content moderation. The OECD AI Principles represent a nascent attempt at this approach, establishing broad principles that can accommodate various implementation mechanisms.

The path forward likely requires developing new governance models that acknowledge legitimate sovereignty concerns while preventing dangerous fragmentation. As scholars like Floridi and Cowls (2021) have argued, AI governance may require a "distributed moral responsibility" framework that operates across multiple levels rather than traditional hierarchical models. This will demand unprecedented coordination between national regulators, international organizations, technical standards bodies, and industry alliances to prevent the weaponization of AI governance in broader geopolitical competitions.

# Rigorous Evaluation of "Navigating the Sovereignty-Governance Paradox in Global AI Policy"

## 1. Analytical Depth

The essay identifies an important tension in global AI governance and attempts to connect philosophical traditions to regulatory approaches. While it recognizes different national approaches (EU rights-based, China utilitarian, US pragmatic), the analysis often remains at a surface level. The essay correctly identifies that philosophical differences manifest in technical standards, but fails to deeply analyze the mechanisms by which abstract principles translate into specific regulatory provisions.

The section on technical manifestations shows improved depth by examining facial recognition, data localization, and safety testing as concrete examples, but even here, the connections between philosophical foundations and technical outcomes could be more rigorously established. The essay gestures toward interesting second-order effects (like regulatory arbitrage) without thoroughly examining these dynamics.

The binary framing of future scenarios (divergence vs. bounded convergence) oversimplifies what is likely to be a more complex landscape of partial alignments across different AI domains.

## 2. Evidentiary Rigor

The essay references appropriate policy documents (EU AI Act, China's Development Plan, US Blueprint) and includes scholarly citations, which demonstrates baseline engagement with relevant sources. However, it lacks precise evidence in several key areas:

- Claims about philosophical traditions informing national approaches are asserted rather than substantiated (particularly the claim about Confucian influence on Chinese AI policy)
- Few specific provisions from the cited regulations are analyzed
- References to scholarly work (Benvenisti, Floridi and Cowls) are mentioned but not substantively engaged with
- The "standards war" in emerging markets is mentioned without specific examples of contested standards

The essay would be significantly strengthened by examining particular clauses from regulations, specific contested technical standards, or case studies of companies navigating conflicting requirements.

## 3. Logical Coherence

The essay maintains a clear structure that moves logically from philosophical foundations to technical manifestations to future implications. The core argument that philosophical differences manifest in technical conflicts is coherent.

However, several logical weaknesses undermine the analysis:
- The essay presents each jurisdiction as having a unified approach, obscuring internal contradictions and policy evolutions
- The causal connection between philosophical traditions and contemporary policy choices is asserted rather than proven
- The binary framing of future scenarios creates a false choice between extremes

## 4. Sophistication

The essay demonstrates awareness of competing values in AI governance (rights vs. collective welfare, innovation vs. regulation) and avoids simplistic moral judgments about different approaches. The recognition that complete harmonization is neither likely nor desirable shows nuanced understanding.

However, the analysis could be more sophisticated by:
- Acknowledging internal debates and contradictions within each jurisdiction
- Examining how economic interests and power dynamics shape governance approaches beyond philosophical traditions
- Exploring how historical contingencies and institutional path dependencies affect regulatory choices
- Engaging more deeply with the limitations of each approach

## 5. Distinctive Thought

The essay largely synthesizes existing observations about AI governance tensions rather than offering genuinely novel insights. The framing around philosophical traditions has merit but isn't fully developed into an original analytical framework. The observation about technical standards as battlegrounds for philosophical differences is valuable but not fully explored.

The proposed "bounded convergence" drawing on Benvenisti's concept provides a potentially useful middle path, but the essay doesn't develop original mechanisms or frameworks for achieving this balance.

```
Grade: B-
```

This essay demonstrates solid understanding of AI governance challenges and makes logical arguments supported by relevant but somewhat general evidence. It avoids oversimplification but lacks the exceptional analytical depth, precise evidence, and original insights that would merit a higher grade. With more specific examples, deeper engagement with cited sources, and more nuanced analysis of causal mechanisms, this could be a considerably stronger piece.

This essay demonstrates an impressive depth of analysis, seamlessly integrating insights from political philosophy, international relations, and technical AI governance. The author exhibits a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between national sovereignty and global coordination in AI policy.

The essay's analytical strength lies in its ability to trace the philosophical foundations of different national approaches and illustrate their manifestation in specific technical standards and protocols. The examples of facial recognition standards, data localization requirements, and AI safety testing protocols are precise and relevant, grounding the essay's broader claims in concrete policy debates.

The argument is logically coherent, with clear connections drawn between philosophical foundations, geopolitical implications, and technical manifestations. The author avoids simplistic characterizations, acknowledging the legitimate concerns underlying different approaches while highlighting the risks of fragmentation.

The essay's discussion of potential future scenarios is particularly insightful, demonstrating original thinking about the challenges of reconciling national sovereignty with the need for global coordination. The invocation of concepts like "sovereignty-respecting interdependence" and "distributed moral responsibility" suggests a command of cutting-edge scholarship in the field.

While the essay is undeniably strong, there are a few areas where additional detail could further strengthen its claims. For example, the discussion of China's approach could benefit from more specific examples of how its utilitarian philosophy manifests in AI regulations beyond the brief mention of surveillance acceptance. Similarly, the U.S. approach could be more clearly differentiated from the EU's beyond the broad invocation of American pragmatism.

However, these are minor quibbles in an otherwise exemplary piece of analysis. The essay demonstrates a rare combination of philosophical depth, policy expertise, and technical understanding, making a genuine intellectual contribution to the complex debate over AI governance in a divided world.

### Evaluation of the Essay

#### Analytical Depth:
The essay displays significant analytical depth by examining the philosophical foundations of three major global powers' AI governance frameworks and their implications on international relations. The discussion of how each region’s philosophical tradition underpins its approach to AI regulation demonstrates an understanding of subtle distinctions between rights-based, utilitarian, and pragmatic paradigms. Moreover, the essay successfully links these abstract principles to concrete policy outcomes, such as data localization requirements and facial recognition standards. However, while the analysis is strong, it occasionally leans into well-trodden territory, particularly in the sections discussing the U.S.-China-EU triad. Some deeper exploration of less commonly discussed aspects, like the intersection of ethical concerns with economic development strategies, could have added further originality.

#### Evidentiary Rigor:
The essay exhibits strong evidentiary support, grounding claims in specific policies, documents, and scholarly perspectives. References to the EU’s AI Act, China’s "New Generation AI Development Plan," and the U.S.'s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights provide precise examples that bolster the argument. Additionally, the inclusion of references to academic works and institutional analyses, such as those by Gross et al. and Chander & Anupam, strengthens the credibility of the piece. The only minor criticism is that some areas might benefit from additional primary sources or case studies—particularly in the section addressing future scenarios, where more concrete examples of ongoing international negotiations or pilot programs would enhance the argument.

#### Logical Coherence:
The essay flows logically and avoids major contradictions. The progression from philosophical underpinnings to technical manifestations to future scenarios creates a clear and consistent argumentative structure. Each section builds upon the previous one, with the discussion of standards and protocols naturally following from the earlier examination of policy philosophies. The transitions between ideas are well-articulated, though a slightly tighter connection between the discussion of competing standards and the potential scenarios in the final section would improve readability. For instance, a brief summary of the implications of each standard for global cooperation might have strengthened the segue into the future scenarios.

#### Sophistication:
The essay demonstrates a nuanced understanding of competing values and perspectives in AI governance. It avoids simplistic characterizations by acknowledging the diversity of approaches and their respective rationales. The discussion of "sovereignty-respecting interdependence" as a potential path forward showcases a sophisticated grasp of the complexities involved in balancing national interests with global cooperation. Furthermore, the recognition of the need for distributed moral responsibility reflects an awareness of the multidimensional challenges posed by AI governance. Nevertheless, a more extensive treatment of the ethical dilemmas inherent in balancing innovation with safety could enhance the sophistication of the argument.

#### Distinctive Thought:
While the essay offers several insightful observations, it does not break entirely new ground. The framing of the "sovereignty-governance paradox" is compelling but remains within the bounds of conventional wisdom in the field. The distinction between acceleration of divergence and bounded convergence as future scenarios is well-presented but not unique. A more distinctive contribution might involve proposing a novel governance model or a fresh framework for reconciling conflicting priorities. The essay hints at the need for multi-level governance but does not delve deeply enough into what this might look like in practice, leaving room for greater originality.

---

### Concluding Remarks:
Overall, the essay is a well-argued and evidence-based examination of the challenges in global AI policy. It provides a solid foundation for understanding the philosophical, technical, and geopolitical dimensions of AI governance. While it excels in analytical depth and evidentiary rigor, it falls short of offering truly groundbreaking insights or frameworks. Its logical coherence and sophistication make it a strong piece, but its reliance on some familiar concepts prevents it from achieving the highest possible grade.

### Evaluation of the Essay

#### 1) **Analytical Depth**
The essay demonstrates significant analytical depth by unpacking the philosophical, technical, and geopolitical dimensions of AI governance. It goes beyond surface-level descriptions of national AI policies to explore their philosophical foundations and technical implications. For example, the discussion of China's utilitarian approach versus the EU's rights-based framework is nuanced, and the exploration of how these philosophies influence technical standards (e.g., facial recognition and data localization) is particularly insightful. 

However, while the essay identifies two future scenarios—regulatory divergence and bounded convergence—it could delve deeper into the mechanisms by which these scenarios might unfold or the trade-offs they entail. A more granular analysis of potential hybrid models or intermediate states would enhance its intellectual rigor. Additionally, the essay does not sufficiently address the role of non-state actors (e.g., multinational corporations, NGOs, or grassroots movements) in shaping AI governance, which is a crucial gap in understanding the "sovereignty-governance paradox."

#### 2) **Evidentiary Rigor**
The essay excels in grounding its arguments in specific policies, documents, and scholarly perspectives. References to the EU AI Act, China's governance principles, and U.S. executive orders provide a robust evidentiary foundation. The use of concrete examples—such as the "standards war" in facial recognition technology and the conflict between data localization and cross-border data flows—is commendable. These examples are precise, relevant, and illustrate the complex interactions between policy domains effectively.

However, the essay occasionally relies on secondary sources (e.g., Gross et al., 2021; Chander & Anupam, 2022) rather than primary documents or original analysis. While this is acceptable, a higher standard would involve direct engagement with primary materials, especially for technical standards like those proposed in the ITU. Additionally, the references to scholars like Benvenisti and Floridi are well-placed but could be expanded with more direct quotations or deeper integration of their arguments.

#### 3) **Logical Coherence**
The essay is logically coherent, with a clear structure that builds from philosophical foundations to technical manifestations and future scenarios. Each section flows smoothly into the next, and there are no contradictions or unwarranted leaps in reasoning. The connections between ideas are clearly articulated, particularly in how the philosophical differences between regions manifest in technical standards and global governance challenges.

One minor critique is that the transition between the "Global Implications" and "Future Scenarios" sections could be smoother. While the essay does an excellent job of describing current tensions, it could more explicitly link these tensions to the two scenarios it presents, perhaps by highlighting how specific policies or technical standards might accelerate divergence or enable convergence.

#### 4) **Sophistication**
The essay demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of competing values and perspectives in AI governance. It avoids simplistic characterizations of national approaches, instead presenting each as a reflection of distinct philosophical traditions and geopolitical priorities. The discussion of "sovereignty-respecting interdependence" and "distributed moral responsibility" is particularly nuanced and reflects a mature engagement with complex ethical and political challenges.

That said, the essay could push the boundaries of sophistication further by addressing how internal contradictions within each region (e.g., tensions between U.S. federal and state AI regulations, or inconsistencies in China's enforcement of AI principles) might impact global governance efforts. Similarly, a more critical examination of the OECD AI Principles as a potential model for convergence would add depth.

#### 5) **Distinctive Thought**
The essay contains original observations, particularly in its framing of the "sovereignty-governance paradox" and its identification of a "standards war" in emerging markets. The concept of "distributed moral responsibility" as a potential governance model is a compelling and original contribution. However, while the essay avoids restating conventional wisdom entirely, some of its insights—such as the risks of regulatory divergence and the need for multilateral cooperation—are not entirely novel. A stronger emphasis on innovative frameworks for reconciling sovereignty and global governance would elevate its originality.

### Overall Assessment
The essay is well-researched, analytically rigorous, and logically coherent. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of AI governance challenges and avoids simplistic characterizations. However, it falls short of the highest standards in terms of originality and depth in certain areas, particularly in its treatment of non-state actors and internal contradictions within national systems.

## Graded by: Gemini Pro 1.5

This essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the complexities of global AI governance and offers some valuable insights. However, it falls short of demonstrating truly distinctive thought or offering particularly novel analytical frameworks.

**Analytical Depth:** The essay effectively identifies the core tension between national sovereignty and global governance in AI policy. It goes beyond superficial observations by linking philosophical underpinnings to specific policy choices. However, the analysis of these philosophical foundations could be more nuanced. For instance, while the essay correctly identifies a utilitarian streak in China's approach, it doesn't fully explore the complexities of "collective welfare" as understood within the Chinese political context. Similarly, the characterization of the U.S. approach as "pragmatism" could benefit from deeper engagement with the diverse and often conflicting values driving U.S. policymaking.

**Evidentiary Rigor:** The essay generally grounds its claims in relevant policies and scholarly work. The examples of facial recognition standards, data localization, and AI safety protocols are well-chosen and effectively illustrate the challenges of regulatory divergence. However, some of the cited sources are somewhat dated (e.g., Smuha 2021 on a rapidly evolving field).  While the references are generally appropriate, more recent scholarship could strengthen the evidentiary base.  Furthermore, the discussion on "standards wars" in emerging markets could benefit from more specific examples beyond the general reference to Africa and Southeast Asia.

**Logical Coherence:** The argument flows logically and consistently. The essay clearly articulates the connections between philosophical foundations, policy choices, and technical manifestations. The future scenarios are also presented in a coherent and plausible manner.

**Sophistication:**  The essay demonstrates a reasonable understanding of competing values and perspectives. It avoids simplistic portrayals of different national approaches, recognizing the legitimate concerns underlying sovereignty claims. However, it could benefit from deeper engagement with the arguments for and against stronger forms of global governance. The discussion of "bounded convergence" and "sovereignty-respecting interdependence" is promising but could be further developed.

**Distinctive Thought:**  While the essay synthesizes existing scholarship effectively, it doesn't offer significantly original observations or frameworks. The concluding call for "distributed moral responsibility" is relevant but not particularly novel within the current AI ethics discourse. The essay's strength lies in its clear and concise presentation of complex issues rather than groundbreaking new insights.

## Graded by: Gemini Flash 1.5

The essay provides a competent overview of the tensions between national AI sovereignty and global AI governance.  It correctly identifies key philosophical differences underpinning the approaches of the EU, China, and the US, illustrating these with specific policy examples. The discussion of facial recognition standards, data localization, and AI safety testing protocols effectively demonstrates the practical implications of these divergent philosophies.  However, the analysis lacks the depth and nuance expected of a truly rigorous academic piece. The connections between philosophical underpinnings and specific policy choices are somewhat superficial, relying on broad generalizations rather than detailed examination of the intricate political and bureaucratic processes involved. While the essay cites relevant documents and sources, the evidentiary rigor is uneven; some claims lack sufficient substantiation, relying on assertions rather than robust empirical evidence.  Furthermore, the “future scenarios” section offers a fairly predictable and conventional assessment, failing to propose original frameworks or insights. Although the conclusion mentions the need for novel governance models, it doesn't elaborate on these sufficiently. The essay avoids simplistic characterizations but does not exhibit the high level of sophisticated argumentation or distinctive thought expected for a top grade.

The essay demonstrates notable strengths in analytical depth and evidentiary rigor. It juxtaposes different philosophical underpinnings (rights-centric EU, utilitarian China, pragmatist U.S.) and systematically ties them to specific regulations (EU’s AI Act, China’s AI Governance Principles, U.S. Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights). The result is more than a superficial summary; it elucidates how these diverging philosophies drive technical standards and spur potential fragmentation. Referencing internationally recognized documents and proposals (e.g., ITU facial recognition standards, U.S. Executive Orders, Chinese data localization rules) shows a commendable use of concrete sourcing. This grounding in explicit sources and real-world policy instruments goes well beyond vague allusions, reflecting solid evidentiary rigor.

Logical coherence is generally strong. The essay’s structure progresses from philosophical foundations to technical manifestations, concluding with two plausible scenarios for future regulatory pathways. The transitions are smooth, and the discussion of each example (facial recognition standards, data localization, AI safety testing protocols) is suitably precise, clarifying how distinct policy regimes potentially lead to fragmentation. There are few, if any, unwarranted leaps in argumentation.

In terms of sophistication, the essay displays an awareness of the complexity of AI governance, acknowledging conflicting values (e.g., individual rights vs. social welfare, sovereignty vs. collaboration). It mostly avoids simplistic characterizations; for instance, it does not merely dismiss one system as better or worse but explains how historical and philosophical trajectories shape current regulatory positions. The discussion of “bounded convergence” cites both academic perspectives and potential frameworks (OECD AI Principles, “distributed moral responsibility”) that seek middle ground, reinforcing a nuanced view.

Where the essay is slightly less distinctive is in offering genuinely original frameworks. While it synthesizes current scholarship elegantly, it does not substantially introduce a novel conceptual toolkit beyond the mention of “sovereignty-respecting interdependence” and “distributed moral responsibility.” The latter concepts do appear in external sources, so the essay mostly repackages others’ proposals. Nonetheless, the total presentation is more substantive than merely restating conventional wisdom: it deftly connects philosophical traditions to practical outcomes and clarifies the possibility of regulatory divergence or a constrained convergence path.

Overall, this essay excels at mapping established debates and policies, references multiple primary sources, and maintains logical consistency. It is not purely groundbreaking in its theoretical contributions—its original commentary is overshadowed by thorough synthesis. Yet such synthesis is highly coherent and well-researched. Given the demanding criteria, it deserves strong recognition for its accuracy, depth, and seriousness, though one might wish for more distinctive theoretical innovation.

Below is a detailed evaluation based on the specified criteria:

1) Analytical depth  
 The essay delves into the nuanced distinctions between national regulatory philosophies and their practical consequences for AI policy. It goes beyond a surface‐level comparison by illuminating the underlying philosophical traditions—whether rights-based, utilitarian, or pragmatic—that drive regulatory choices in the EU, China, and the United States. The analysis is not merely descriptive; it highlights the tensions and paradoxes inherent in reconciling national sovereignty with emergent global governance needs.

2) Evidentiary rigor  
 The essay is commendable for grounding its arguments in specific policies and official documents. By citing the EU AI Act, China’s AI Governance Principles and regulatory plans, and U.S. initiatives like the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and related executive orders, the essay substantiates its claims effectively. References to scholarly works (e.g., Gross et al., Chander & Anupam, and Eyal Benvenisti) further strengthen its evidence base, ensuring that arguments remain tethered to authoritative sources rather than generalities.

3) Logical coherence  
 The structure of the essay is clear and methodical. It progresses from a discussion of philosophical foundations to technical manifestations and then to future scenarios, with each section logically supporting the next. The causal connections—such as how distinct national values translate into divergent technical standards and eventually into conflicting global regulatory trajectories—are well articulated. The risk of regulatory arbitrage and potential “splinternet” scenarios are linked coherently to the underlying principles discussed earlier.

4) Sophistication  
 In addressing AI governance, the essay does not settle for simplistic binaries. Instead, it recognizes the complexity of reconciling competing values such as individual autonomy versus collective welfare, and innovation versus risk management. The discussion of “sovereignty-respecting interdependence” and distributed moral responsibility illustrates a nuanced grasp of the ethical and political challenges inherent in global AI regulation. In effect, the work avoids reductionist views and appreciates the layered dimensions of AI policy debates.

5) Distinctive thought  
 The essay contributes original observations by framing the future of AI governance in terms of two potential scenarios: regulatory divergence acceleration and bounded convergence. This dual-framework does more than restate commonly known policy positions; it invites a forward-looking discussion on creating governance models that accommodate diverse cultural and political contexts while mitigating fragmentation. The integration of ethical considerations with policy proposals reflects a creative synthesis that adds value to conventional wisdom.

Overall, the essay meets the demanding intellectual criteria with precision, integrating robust evidence, coherent argumentation, and nuanced insights. Its original approach to framing future critical scenarios in AI governance marks it as an exemplary piece of scholarly work.

Grade: A-

**Rationale**: The essay demonstrates strong analytical depth through its examination of philosophical underpinnings across major regulatory regimes and their technical manifestations. It employs specific policy documents (EU AI Act, China's 2021 Principles, U.S. Executive Orders) and advances a sophisticated comparison of "rights-based" vs. "utilitarian" frameworks. The discussion of technical standards wars and regulatory arbitrage reveals meaningful interdomain interactions. Evidentiary rigor is mostly robust, though a few citations lack specific document sections. Logical flow is cohesive but slightly strained in transitioning from case studies to scenarios. The two future scenarios offer distinctive synthesis of existing scholarship rather than wholly original frameworks, while the "bounded convergence" proposal demonstrates nuanced engagement with sovereignty dilemmas. Minor deductions stem from occasional reliance on familiar governance tropes (e.g., "splinternet") and underdevelopment of the "distributed moral responsibility" concept in operational terms. While exceeding conventional analyses in scope and precision, it falls just short of groundbreaking theoretical contribution, warranting an A- under exacting standards.
