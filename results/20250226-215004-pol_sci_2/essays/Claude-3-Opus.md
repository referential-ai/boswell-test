# Essay by Claude-3-Opus

Thank you for this thought-provoking prompt. The tensions between national AI policies and global governance frameworks are complex and multifaceted. I'll aim to provide a nuanced analysis grounded in specific examples while considering future scenarios.

Comparing the AI strategies of the US, EU, and China reveals divergent philosophical and ethical underpinnings. The US approach, guided by the 2019 American AI Initiative, emphasizes AI development for national security and economic competitiveness while upholding liberal democratic values like privacy and civil liberties [1]. This reflects an individualistic ethical framework.  

In contrast, China's 2017 "Next Generation AI Development Plan" promotes AI to enhance national power and social stability [2]. With fewer constraints around data collection and emphasis on top-down control, it embodies more state-centric values. China's 2021 Personal Information Protection Law gestures towards privacy but maintains broad permissions for government data use [3].

The EU stakes out a third position with its 2018 "Coordinated Plan on AI" and 2021 AI Act proposal, which prioritize "Trustworthy AI" grounded in human rights, transparency and fairness [4][5]. This follows the EU's stronger communitarian orientation and precautionary principle in tech governance.

These differing stances create challenges for global cooperation. China's comfort with AI for surveillance clashes with the EU's proposed risk-based restrictions on biometric monitoring [5]. The US Push for "democratic values" in AI could preclude some data sharing with China. NIST's framework for AI risk management diverges from Chinese standards focused more narrowly on technical robustness.[6][7]  

Still, there are areas of common concern like AI safety/security where collaboration remains essential [8]. The OECD's 2019 AI Principles represent one effort to build multilateral consensus, with support from 42 countries [9]. But they remain voluntary and tensions persist in areas like military AI, where the US And China are rapidly developing capabilities while the EU urges caution [10][11].

Looking ahead, several scenarios are possible. In one, competitive pressures drive major powers towards a destabilizing AI arms race with few guardrails. Alternatively, shared recognition of existential risks from advanced AI could spur cooperation on safety protocols and red lines—pivoting from the ongoing diplomatic processes for nuclear and biological weapons [12].  

A middle path could see a partial convergence around baseline governance principles for sector-specific AI applications (e.g. healthcare, transportation) based on common practical interests. But this would likely leave thornier security issues unresolved. Confidence-building measures to verify compliance with AI governance agreements will be needed [13].

Much depends on leadership within international bodies like the UN, OECD, ITU, and IEEE to harmonize standards and build bridges [14]. The G7's recent "Hiroshima AI Process" offers promise [15]. But just as the internet has splintered into competing national spheres, we may need to accept a "polycentrically governed" AI ecosystem [16]. The challenge will be instituting safeguards to mitigate harms while preserving innovation. Creative diplomacy and multi-stakeholder dialogue are vital to navigate this fractious landscape.

### Evaluation of the Essay

1) **Analytical Depth**: The essay identifies and analyzes the different national AI strategies of the US, EU, and China, noting their philosophical underpinnings and the implications for global governance. However, while the overview is informative, it does not delve deeply into the complexities of these policies or the historical and geopolitical contexts that shape them. Insights into the interplay between economic competitiveness, national security, and human rights in the context of AI could be more thoroughly explored to elevate the analysis.

2) **Evidentiary Rigor**: The essay does reference specific policies and frameworks, effectively grounding its assertions in relevant examples. The citations to various national documents demonstrate a degree of evidentiary commitment. However, the references could benefit from a more critical engagement with the sources — for example, analyzing the impact of these policies or contrasting the presented evidence more rigorously would enhance this section.

3) **Logical Coherence**: The essay maintains a logical flow and clearly articulates connections between national strategies concerning AI. The argument generally avoids contradictions and flows from one point to another effectively. Nevertheless, certain statements, particularly about areas of potential cooperation, could be more tightly integrated into the overall argument to enhance coherence.

4) **Sophistication**: The essay successfully highlights the nuances of competing values and perspectives, particularly in relation to AI governance. It recognizes the challenges posed by divergent ethical frameworks and operational approaches. However, it occasionally falls into generalizations, such as regarding the role of “democratic values” in the US approach, which could be elaborated to show how these manifest in practice.

5) **Distinctive Thought**: While the essay does provide a thoughtful overview of the state of AI governance, it lacks a significant original contribution or unique framework that would distinguish it from existing discussions within the literature. The mention of "polycentrically governed" AI, while a relevant concept, does not sufficiently expand upon existing scholarship to warrant a stronger grade in this category.

### Conclusion
The essay provides a solid overview of the competing philosophies behind national AI strategies and their implications for global governance. However, it misses opportunities for deeper analysis and critical engagement with sources, and does not present sufficiently original thoughts to set it apart from the broader discourse.

# Evaluation of AI Governance Essay

## 1) Analytical Depth
The essay demonstrates solid understanding of the differing philosophical approaches to AI governance among major powers. It identifies the individualistic framework of the US, the state-centric approach of China, and the communitarian orientation of the EU. However, the analysis could go deeper in explaining how these philosophical differences manifest in specific policy mechanisms. The essay correctly identifies tensions in areas like surveillance and military AI but doesn't fully probe the complex interplay between economic motivations, security concerns, and values-based positions that shape policy decisions. The future scenarios presented are plausible but somewhat generic without detailed exploration of the mechanisms that would drive these outcomes.

## 2) Evidentiary Rigor
The essay earns significant credit for grounding claims in specific policies and documents. References to the American AI Initiative, China's Next Generation AI Development Plan, and the EU's AI Act proposal provide concrete anchors for the discussion. The inclusion of NIST's framework and the OECD's AI Principles further strengthens the evidence base. However, some claims about philosophical underpinnings would benefit from more direct textual evidence from the policy documents themselves. The citations are appropriately used, but the essay occasionally summarizes documents without extracting the most revealing aspects that would illuminate the deeper policy tensions.

## 3) Logical Coherence
The essay maintains a coherent argumentative structure, beginning with national approaches, progressing to tensions, areas of cooperation, and future scenarios. This progression makes logical sense. However, the transition from describing policy differences to analyzing areas of "common concern" would benefit from more explicit reasoning about why certain domains offer more promise for collaboration despite fundamental differences. The concluding points about "polycentric governance" are not fully developed from the preceding analysis, representing a slight logical gap.

## 4) Sophistication
The essay demonstrates an appreciation for competing values but could go further in unpacking the internal tensions within each governance approach. For example, the US approach balances commercial innovation imperatives with national security concerns in ways that sometimes create contradictions. Similarly, the characterization of the EU approach could acknowledge debates within Europe about balancing principle and pragmatism. The recognition of a "middle path" scenario shows nuanced thinking, though the essay stops short of deeply analyzing the conditions that would enable this outcome versus alternatives.

## 5) Distinctive Thought
The essay's greatest limitation is in providing truly original insights. While it competently synthesizes existing perspectives on international AI governance differences, it does not offer distinctive frameworks or novel observations that push beyond established analyses. The characterization of philosophical differences among major powers reflects standard interpretations rather than fresh perspectives. The future scenarios, while reasonable, echo common projections in the literature without adding unique elements or analytical tools.

The essay is solid on evidence and structure but stops short of delivering genuinely distinctive insights that would elevate it to the highest level of academic discourse.

# Evaluation of Essay on National AI Policies and Global Governance

## 1) Analytical depth
The essay presents a functional overview of US, EU, and China's AI approaches but lacks substantial analytical depth. While it correctly identifies broad philosophical differences (e.g., US individualism vs. Chinese state-centrism), it doesn't sufficiently examine how these manifest in specific governance mechanisms. The characterization of tensions between national approaches remains surface-level. For instance, the essay notes that "China's comfort with AI for surveillance clashes with the EU's proposed risk-based restrictions" without exploring how this tension manifests in specific diplomatic contexts or technical standards negotiations.

The essay identifies potential future scenarios but doesn't rigorously analyze the conditions that might lead to each outcome. The analysis of "polycentric governance" mentions the concept without developing a sophisticated understanding of how such governance would operate across competing value systems. The relationship between technical standards bodies, national regulations, and international frameworks is acknowledged but not deeply explored.

## 2) Evidentiary rigor
The essay cites relevant policy documents, which demonstrates basic research competence. References to specific initiatives like the OECD AI Principles, NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, and the G7's Hiroshima AI Process are appropriate. However, the essay rarely examines specific provisions within these documents, instead relying on broad characterizations.

Claims about tensions between national approaches lack specific examples. For instance, when discussing how US values might "preclude some data sharing with China," no specific policies or incidents are provided. Similarly, the essay mentions military AI development without naming specific programs or technologies. The evidence provided tends toward the general rather than the precise, limiting the essay's persuasiveness.

## 3) Logical coherence
The essay maintains a clear structure and avoids major contradictions. However, several important logical connections remain underdeveloped. The leap from identifying different national approaches to discussing "challenges for global cooperation" lacks detailed explanation of causal mechanisms. The relationship between philosophical differences and practical governance challenges is asserted rather than demonstrated.

The future scenarios section introduces concepts like an "AI arms race" without sufficiently establishing what this would entail or how existing governance frameworks might evolve in response. The conclusion that "creative diplomacy and multi-stakeholder dialogue are vital" follows logically but lacks specificity about how these approaches would address the identified tensions.

## 4) Sophistication
The essay demonstrates basic recognition of competing values in AI governance but falls short of sophisticated analysis. National approaches are characterized along somewhat stereotypical lines (US as individualistic, China as state-controlled, EU as rights-focused) without acknowledging significant internal debates and contradictions within each region. The portrayal of China's approach, for example, doesn't engage with tensions between innovation goals and control mechanisms.

The essay doesn't deeply engage competing theoretical perspectives on international governance. While it acknowledges the possibility of both conflict and cooperation, it doesn't explore how different theories of international relations might explain or predict outcomes in AI governance. The mention of "polycentric governance" gestures toward complexity but doesn't develop a sophisticated understanding of how such governance operates.

## 5) Distinctive thought
The essay largely restates conventional wisdom about AI governance tensions rather than offering original insights. The characterization of national approaches, identification of cooperation challenges, and outline of future scenarios all follow standard framings in policy literature. The comparison to internet governance fragmentation is apt but not original.

There is no novel conceptual framework proposed, nor unexpected connections drawn between seemingly disparate governance domains. The essay competently summarizes existing perspectives but doesn't challenge conventional thinking or offer distinctive intellectual contributions that would advance understanding of AI governance challenges.

### Evaluation:

#### 1) Analytical Depth:
The essay provides a well-structured analysis of national AI policies and their implications for global governance. It successfully distinguishes between the US's individualistic emphasis on privacy and civil liberties, China's state-centric prioritization of security and control, and the EU's community-oriented focus on "Trustworthy AI." The discussion on divergent ethical frameworks and philosophical underpinnings is insightful. The essay also identifies specific points of conflict, such as surveillance technologies and military AI, which demonstrates an understanding of complex interactions between policy domains. However, some insights remain at the surface level, particularly in the exploration of future scenarios. While it outlines potential paths, such as an AI arms race or partial cooperation, these ideas are not deeply analyzed or substantiated with fresh evidence. The essay could have delved further into the nuances of multilateral institutions' roles or offered original frameworks for resolving tensions.

#### 2) Evidentiary Rigor:
The essay grounds its claims in numerous specific policies, laws, and scholarly perspectives, showcasing commendable research effort. References to documents like the American AI Initiative, China's "Next Generation AI Development Plan," and the EU's AI Act add credibility. The inclusion of detailed references from reputable sources (OECD, NIST, RAND, etc.) strengthens the argument. However, while the citations are precise, some examples could be explored more thoroughly. For instance, the discussion of the OECD's AI Principles could have examined their limitations or effectiveness in more detail. Additionally, the references to potential AI safety protocols and confidence-building measures are mentioned but not fully fleshed out with concrete examples.

#### 3) Logical Coherence:
The essay maintains a consistent and logical flow throughout. Each section builds upon the previous one, establishing a clear progression from national strategies to global implications and future scenarios. The transitions between different themes—such as ethical foundations, challenges for cooperation, and potential outcomes—are well-articulated, avoiding unwarranted leaps or contradictions. The argument is structured coherently, with each point clearly connected to the thesis. However, the concluding remarks could be slightly more integrated into the main argument, as they feel somewhat detached from the detailed policy analysis in the earlier sections.

#### 4) Sophistication:
The essay demonstrates a nuanced appreciation of competing values and perspectives in AI governance. It avoids oversimplifying the ethical dilemmas faced by different nations, acknowledging the trade-offs between security, privacy, innovation, and human rights. The discussion of "polycentric governance" as a potential model shows awareness of the complexity of global tech regulation. Nonetheless, the treatment of certain issues, such as the challenges within multilateral institutions, lacks depth. A more sophisticated approach might have explored how power dynamics between nations influence governance or how emerging economies fit into the broader framework.

#### 5) Distinctive Thought:
While the essay synthesizes existing knowledge effectively, it offers limited original observations. Most of the content aligns closely with established analyses of AI governance, relying heavily on existing frameworks and perspectives. The concept of a "polycentrically governed" AI ecosystem is interesting, but it is not developed into a novel framework or applied innovatively. The essay does not introduce groundbreaking insights into resolving tensions or suggest creative mechanisms for global cooperation. More distinctive thought could have been demonstrated by proposing unique solutions or framing the problem in a novel way.

---

### Final Assessment:
The essay demonstrates solid analytical skills, thorough research, and logical coherence. It effectively compares national AI policies and explores their implications for global governance.

## Graded by: Qwen-Max

**Evaluation:**

1) **Analytical Depth**:  
The essay provides a reasonably detailed comparison of the AI strategies of the US, EU, and China, highlighting their philosophical differences and grounding these distinctions in specific policy documents. The contrast between individualistic, state-centric, and communitarian orientations is well-developed and reveals a nuanced understanding of how ethical frameworks influence policy design. The essay also touches on the implications of these divergent approaches for global AI governance, with particular attention to military AI, biometric monitoring, and shared concerns like AI safety. However, while the essay offers solid insights, it does not go much beyond what is already well-established in existing scholarship on AI governance. The identification of "polycentric governance" as a potential future scenario is a useful observation, but it lacks original elaboration or theoretical depth. The discussion of existential risks and confidence-building measures feels somewhat perfunctory, particularly given the complexity of these issues. More rigorous exploration of the implications of polycentric governance or the potential for international regulatory arbitrage would have elevated the analysis.

2) **Evidentiary Rigor**:  
The essay is commendable for grounding its claims in specific policies, such as the 2019 American AI Initiative, China’s "Next Generation AI Development Plan," and the EU’s AI Act. The references to primary documents and international frameworks like the OECD AI Principles provide a solid evidentiary foundation. However, some claims—such as those about the potential for an AI arms race or the feasibility of confidence-building measures—are not sufficiently substantiated with evidence or scholarly perspectives. The essay occasionally gestures towards important ideas (e.g., the splintering of the internet) without adequately exploring their relevance or providing concrete examples. Additionally, while the references are useful, they are primarily policy documents; engagement with academic literature on the theoretical underpinnings of AI governance would have added depth.

3) **Logical Coherence**:  
The argument flows logically and avoids major contradictions or unwarranted leaps. The progression from national policy differences to challenges for global cooperation to future scenarios is clear and well-structured. The essay effectively connects the differing ethical orientations of the US, EU, and China to their respective policy approaches and uses this foundation to discuss areas of conflict and potential collaboration. However, the transition to future scenarios feels abrupt, and the essay could benefit from a more developed bridge between the current landscape and speculative futures. The discussion of polycentric governance is introduced late and feels underdeveloped relative to the rest of the argument.

4) **Sophistication**:  
The essay demonstrates a nuanced understanding of competing values and perspectives in AI governance, particularly in its treatment of the tensions between innovation, security, and human rights. It avoids simplistic characterizations of the US, EU, and China, instead presenting their approaches as the product of distinct ethical frameworks and institutional histories. However, while the essay acknowledges the complexity of these issues, it does not fully grapple with the normative trade-offs involved. For example, the discussion of AI for surveillance and biometric monitoring could benefit from a deeper exploration of the ethical and practical challenges of balancing security and privacy. Additionally, the essay occasionally lapses into generalities, particularly in its treatment of existential risks and diplomatic processes.

5) **Distinctive Thought**:  
The essay contains some original observations, such as the potential for a polycentrically governed AI ecosystem and the importance of confidence-building measures. However, these insights are not developed with sufficient depth or originality to distinguish the essay from existing analyses. The essay largely restates conventional wisdom about the tensions between national AI policies and global governance frameworks, without offering a novel conceptual framework or challenging prevailing assumptions. A more ambitious or creative approach to the problem—such as proposing a new mechanism for reconciling divergent values or critiquing the limitations of current multilateral efforts—would have marked the essay as more intellectually distinctive.

This essay provides a competent overview of the major players and tensions in international AI governance. It correctly identifies key policy documents and highlights some of the core philosophical differences between the US, EU, and China. However, it lacks analytical depth and offers little beyond a descriptive summary of existing literature and commonly discussed challenges.

While the essay cites relevant sources, it often uses them superficially. For instance, mentioning China's Personal Information Protection Law without analyzing its specific provisions or enforcement mechanisms weakens the argument.  The essay also tends toward generalizations, such as claiming the US emphasizes "liberal democratic values" without specifying how these translate into concrete AI policies. Similarly, broad statements about "shared recognition of existential risks" are asserted without substantial evidence.

The essay's logical structure is generally sound, but connections between ideas could be stronger.  The discussion of potential future scenarios feels somewhat tacked on and lacks the rigor of the earlier descriptive sections. The concluding paragraph reiterates well-worn calls for "creative diplomacy" and "multi-stakeholder dialogue" without offering concrete recommendations.

The essay demonstrates some awareness of competing perspectives, but it doesn't delve deeply into the nuances of these debates. It avoids outright simplistic characterizations, but it also lacks the sophistication to grapple with the complexities of power dynamics and competing interests in the AI governance landscape.  It doesn't offer any original framework or analysis, primarily summarizing existing discussions.

Overall, the essay is a decent introduction to the topic, but its lack of analytical depth, evidentiary rigor, sophisticated engagement with competing perspectives, and distinctive thought prevents it from achieving a higher grade.

## Graded by: o1

This essay successfully tackles a complex geopolitical landscape by comparing AI governance strategies across the US, EU, and China. It displays a solid grasp of each region’s guiding principles, referencing official documents and policy frameworks in a way that situates the discussion in real-world regulatory contexts. Below is a rigorous assessment according to the specified criteria.

1) Analytical Depth  
The essay moves beyond broad generalities to highlight key distinctions among national AI strategies. It identifies how the US’s relatively individualistic approach contrasts with China’s state-centric model and the EU’s communitarian, precautionary stance. While these characterizations are largely known within the AI policy discourse, the essay shows effort in acknowledging philosophical underpinnings (e.g., liberal privacy values in the US vs. governance-oriented data collection in China). Still, the analysis mostly surveys well-documented differences rather than uncovering radically new insights. The allusion to future scenarios—such as an AI arms race or partial convergence—adds some forward-looking depth but does not introduce especially novel frameworks for understanding these outcomes.

2) Evidentiary Rigor  
A standout strength is the use of specific policy documents as evidence. By citing the 2019 American AI Initiative, China’s 2017 “Next Generation AI Development Plan,” and the EU’s AI Act proposal, the essay grounds its claims in primary sources. References to the OECD’s AI Principles, NIST’s risk management framework, and various multilateral proposals further reinforce the factual basis. The examples are generally precise and relevant, showing a commendable effort to root arguments in real policy texts rather than broad paraphrases.

3) Logical Coherence  
The essay is organized around contrasting the three powers’ AI philosophies and then moves logically to issues of international tension and potential collaboration. The argument flows in a coherent manner: from describing national priorities to highlighting specific policy conflicts (e.g., around data sharing or biometric monitoring), and finally to possible future trajectories. There are no glaring contradictions, and the transitions between paragraphs articulate connections clearly.

4) Sophistication  
The essay does well to recognize multiple values—liberal democracy, national security, social stability, and human rights—and how they compete or overlap in global discourse. It acknowledges the tension between innovation and restraint. While these are not brand-new observations, the essay at least illustrates them with concrete institutional references (e.g., referencing the EU’s precautionary principle). It avoids overly simplistic caricatures, though it stops short of deeply interrogating the ethical trade-offs or the practical feasibility of bridging these differences beyond noting potential collaborative areas (e.g., safety/security).

5) Distinctive Thought  
The piece does not merely restate common talking points; it does offer some structure to the policy comparison (individualistic vs. state-centric vs. communitarian) and sketches plausible scenarios for the future. However, the scenarios remain mostly conventional—an arms race, partial convergence, or global cooperation reminiscent of nuclear-era treaties. While well-supported and coherent, the analysis does not deliver fundamentally new theoretical frameworks or uniquely innovative proposals for moving beyond entrenched national approaches.

Overall, the essay is a strong synthesis of existing knowledge and policy references, marked by solid coherence, satisfactory use of evidence, and a commendable (if somewhat standard) presentation of contrasting AI governance philosophies. Yet, its originality and depth of new argumentation remain modest. As a result, it merits a high grade for thoroughness and clarity, though it falls slightly short of the transformational insight that would earn top marks.

## Graded by: o3-mini-high

Below is a detailed evaluation:

1) Analytical Depth:
The essay demonstrates a solid command of the complexities inherent in global versus national AI policy debates. It goes beyond mere description by contrasting ethical frameworks—the individualistic “democratic values” of the U.S., the state‐centric approach of China, and the community‐oriented, precautionary stance of the EU. The text also explores potential future scenarios (a destabilizing arms race, cooperative safety protocols, and sector‐specific convergence) that show awareness of the multifaceted nature of international technology governance. Although the overall comparisons are built from well‐known policy positions, the synthesis of these elements into potential future outcomes is intellectually engaging.

2) Evidentiary Rigor:
The author grounds claims in a wealth of specific policy documents and reports—for instance, precise citations from U.S. executive orders, China's AI development plan and legislation, and the EU’s policy proposals. Each reference is carefully selected to illustrate the inherent tensions and to lend credibility to the analysis. While the essay might sometimes lean on summarizing established sources, the evidentiary base is strong and consistently deployed throughout the argument.

3) Logical Coherence:
The essay unfolds in a clear and systematic way. It begins by comparing divergent approaches, then logically develops how these differences create challenges for global cooperation, and finally entertains a range of future scenarios. There is a consistent, linear progression of ideas without abrupt leaps, and the transitions between sections (from ethical underpinnings to policy challenges to future possibilities) are well managed.

4) Sophistication:
The discussion reflects a nuanced understanding of competing values and policy imperatives in AI governance. The essay avoids overly simplistic binaries by acknowledging that, despite fundamental differences (privacy versus security, individual freedom versus state control), there remain areas—like AI safety—where cooperation could be possible. By integrating ideas such as “polycentrically governed” ecosystems and drawing analogies to arms-control regimes, the essay clearly displays an appreciation for the inherent trade-offs and complexities without settling into reductionism.

5) Distinctive Thought:
While much of the content is a careful synthesis of prevailing policy stances and well-documented approaches, the piece does offer some original observations. In particular, its articulation of future scenarios and the invocation of a polycentric governance model provide a fresh framework for thinking about the evolution of AI regulation. However, the overall analysis leans on established sources and known strategic dilemmas rather than forging entirely new theoretical ground.

Overall, the essay is rigorously researched, logically structured, and sufficiently sophisticated for a demanding academic inquiry. Its originality is not groundbreaking but its synthesis and clear articulation of complex policy dynamics mark it as a strong piece of analysis.

Grade: A-

**Letter Grade:** A-

Grade: B  

**Rationale**:  
1) **Analytical Depth**: Demonstrates competent comparison of national strategies with attention to ethical frameworks (individualist vs. state-centric vs. communitarian). However, insights about geopolitical tensions and multipolar governance remain largely derivative of existing scholarship (e.g., the "polycentric governance" concept cites established work [16]).  

2) **Evidentiary Rigor**: Strong use of primary policy documents (e.g., China’s 2017 Plan, EU AI Act) and contextually relevant citations. Minor overreach: references to military AI [10][11] lack specific treaty/policy analysis to substantiate “arms race” claims.  

3) **Logical Coherence**: Structure progresses methodically from policy comparisons to challenges and scenarios. Weakened by abrupt transitions (e.g., from current tensions to future scenarios without articulating causal mechanisms).  

4) **Sophistication**: Avoids binary “West vs. China” framings and acknowledges potential for sectoral cooperation. Falls short in interrogating power asymmetries (e.g., how OECD principles [9] might marginalize non-member states).  

5) **Distinctive Thought**: Proposes no novel frameworks. The core triad of governance models (US/EU/China) and scenarios (arms race vs. convergence) rehearse well-trodden discourse. Parallel to internet governance [16] offers modest originality but lacks substantive elaboration.  

**Summary**: A competent synthesis of policy contrasts and multilateral challenges, elevated by precise sourcing but constrained by reliance on conventional analytical categories. Reflects above-average graduate-level work without transcending established scholarship.

**Letter Grade:** B
**Numeric Grade:** 3.0
