The diagonal grades in the final table represent each chatbot's self-assessment. Looking at the diagonal cells, we find a mix of A-, B+, and some N/A values (when models couldn't grade themselves). Among those that provided self-assessments, the median self-assigned grade is A-/B+, which generally aligns with the overall median grade across high-performing chatbots (A-) and the median of their grading biases.

## Discussion and Conclusions

In this Boswell Test run, the grades highlight impressive performances: several top-tier models including GPT-4o, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini Pro 1.5, o1, Qwen-Max, o3-mini-high, DeepSeek-R1-Full, and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-32b all achieved an A- median grade. Other models like Claude-3-Sonnet, o1-mini, and grok2-1212 earned B+ grades but with higher percentages (88%). The remaining models earned solid B+ performances. 

The Boswell Quotient provides additional insights beyond raw grades, considering not just performance but also evaluation capabilities and efficiency. Here, Gemini Flash 2.0, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-32b emerged as the top three models with quotients ranging from 88.6 to 89.3.

Clearly, all these models handle challenging essay questions with proficiency. Yet, a prior evaluation of their math-solving skills revealed somewhat weaker results, although when graded on a curve, models from OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), DeepSeek, Qwen, and Grok emerged as notable performers. 

By informally blending these two metrics (essay responses and math abilities), I conclude that, at present time, models from DeepSeek, OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Qwen, and Grok stand out as promising AI problem-solving companions for aspiring university students.
