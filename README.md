# Boswell Test: LLM Comparative Analysis Framework

The Boswell Test is an automated tool for comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) through peer-review, where models grade each other's essays. This implementation is based on the methodology introduced by Peter Luh in his article ["Is AI Chatbot My Boswell?"](https://peterl168.substack.com/p/is-ai-chatbot-my-boswell) (February 2025).

## üåü Introduction: How It Works

This tool automates the process of running a Boswell Test across multiple LLMs. Here's how it works:

1. **Essay Generation**: The system prompts multiple LLMs with the same complex question in a specific domain (like political science or computer science)
2. **Peer Evaluation**: Each LLM grades the essays written by all other models, providing detailed feedback and assigning letter grades (A+, A, A-, etc.)
3. **Bias Analysis**: The system analyzes grading patterns to identify which models grade more strictly or leniently compared to the median
4. **Boswell Quotient**: A comprehensive score (0-100) is calculated for each model based on equal weighting of performance (grades received), evaluation ability (grading consistency), efficiency (response time), and empathy (emotional intelligence)
5. **Visualization**: The framework generates charts and graphs showing performance metrics, grading distributions, timing data, and Boswell Quotient rankings
6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Results are organized in timestamped directories with easy-to-read tables in multiple formats (Markdown, ASCII, CSV, JSON)

The Boswell Test methodology offers several advantages over traditional benchmarks:
- It captures nuanced evaluation capabilities, not just raw performance
- It leverages LLMs' own analytical skills to provide detailed feedback
- It reveals biases in how different models evaluate the same work
- It creates a multidimensional view of model capabilities across different domains
- It calculates a comprehensive "Boswell Quotient" that measures a model's ability to serve as an indispensable AI companion

All of this is automated through a simple command-line interface that handles the entire testing process from essay generation to final report creation.

## üîç What is the Boswell Test?

The Boswell Test works by:

1. **Prompting** multiple LLMs with a domain-specific question to get an essay response from each model
2. **Having** each model grade the essays produced by other models, providing detailed feedback and assigning letter grades
3. **Generating** comprehensive reports with both raw responses and statistical analysis of performance

This approach allows for a multi-dimensional evaluation that goes beyond simple benchmarks by leveraging the analytical capabilities of the models themselves.

   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

Run a test with default settings:

```bash
botwell
```

This uses the newly added command-line interface that provides a simpler way to run tests and manage the framework.

This will run the basic political science test with all verified models.

### Advanced Usage

#### Select a specific domain:

```bash
botwell --domain pol_sci_2
```

#### Run tests on all available domains:

```bash
botwell --all-domains
```

This will sequentially run tests on all domains with the same set of models, creating separate results directories for each domain. When multiple domains are tested, it will also generate:

1. An **aggregate Boswell Quotient** analysis across all domains
2. Visualizations comparing model performance across domains
3. Detailed reports identifying which models are consistent across domains vs. specialized in specific areas

#### Use specific models:

```bash
botwell --models "GPT-4o" "Claude-3-Opus" "Claude-3.7-Sonnet"
```

#### Combine options:

```bash
botwell --all-domains --models "GPT-4o" "Claude-3.7-Sonnet" --skip-verification
```

#### Skip model verification (faster but less reliable):

```bash
botwell --skip-verification
```

#### Configure retry attempts for API calls:

```bash
botwell --max-retries 5
```

#### Custom output file (in addition to organized results directory):

```bash
botwell --output custom_results.json
```

### Model Management

#### Update local models file with available OpenRouter models:

```bash
botwell --update-models
```

This command fetches the current list of available models from OpenRouter's API and saves them to a local JSON file. The output includes model IDs, context lengths, pricing information, and descriptions.

#### Specify custom models file:

```bash
botwell --update-models --models-file my_models.json
```

### Cache Management
The Boswell Test includes cache management utilities to improve performance. The response caching system stores API responses to avoid redundant API calls, especially useful during development and testing.

```bash
# View cache statistics
botwell cache stats

# Clear the entire cache
botwell cache clear

# Clear only expired cache entries
botwell cache clear --expired-only
```

### Domain Creation
You can create new domain definitions easily with the built-in domain creation utility:

```bash
botwell create-domain
```

This interactive tool will guide you through creating a new domain with appropriate prompts for essay generation and grading.

### Report Generation

Reports can now be generated using the built-in report command rather than requiring a separate script execution. This simplifies the workflow and ensures all features are accessible through the same command interface.


Generate comprehensive summary reports from test results:

```bash
# Generate a report for the most recent test results
botwell report --latest

# Generate a report for a specific results directory
botwell report --directory results/20250301-145232-pol_sci_1

# Generate reports for all results directories
botwell report --all
```

### Information Commands

#### List available domains:

```bash
botwell --list-domains
```

#### List available models:

```bash
botwell --list-models

# List only free models
botwell --list-models --free
```

## üìä Results Organization

### Output Artifacts

#### 1. Essay Files (`essays/` directory)

Each essay file is a Markdown document named after the model that produced it, containing:
- The original essay from the model, labeled with the model name
- A "Grading Feedback" section with feedback from each grader
- Letter and numeric grades for each evaluation
- Clear attribution of which model gave which feedback

Example content:
```markdown
# Essay by GPT-4o

[Original essay content...]

---

# Grading Feedback

## Graded by: Claude-3-Opus

[Detailed feedback from Claude-3-Opus...]

**Letter Grade:** A-
**Numeric Grade:** 3.7

---

## Graded by: Claude-3.7-Sonnet

[Detailed feedback from Claude-3.7-Sonnet...]

**Letter Grade:** B+
**Numeric Grade:** 3.3

---
```

#### 2. Grade Tables (multiple formats)

**ASCII Table** (`grades_table.txt`):
```
Model     | GPT-4o | Claude | Claude-S | Median |
----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
GPT-4o    |  ---   |   A-   |    B+    |   B+   |
Claude    |   A    |  ---   |    A-    |   A-   |
Claude-S  |   B+   |   A    |   ---    |   A-   |
```

**Markdown Table** (`grades_table.md`):
| Model | GPT-4o | Claude | Claude-S | Median Grade |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|
| GPT-4o | --- | A- | B+ | B+ |
| Claude | A | --- | A- | A- |
| Claude-S | B+ | A | --- | A- |


**CSV Table** (`grades_table.csv`):
```csv
Model,GPT-4o,Claude,Claude-S,Median Grade
GPT-4o,---,A-,B+,B+
Claude,A,---,A-,A-
Claude-S,B+,A,---,A-
```

#### 3. Grading Bias Analysis

The framework analyzes each model's grading tendencies to identify which models are stricter or more lenient graders:

**ASCII Table** (`grading_bias.txt`):
```
Model     | Median Given | Grading Bias           |
----------|--------------|------------------------|
GPT-4o    |      B+      | Slightly Strict (-1/3) |
Claude    |      A       | Lenient (+1 grade)     |
Claude-S  |      B+      | Neutral                |
----------|--------------|------------------------|
OVERALL   |      B+      | Baseline               |
```

**Markdown Table** (`grading_bias.md`):
| Model | Median Given | Grading Bias | Numeric Bias |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| GPT-4o | B+ | Slightly Strict (-1/3 grade) | -0.33 |
| Claude | A | Lenient (+1 grade) | 0.35 |
| Claude-S | B+ | Neutral | -0.05 |
| **OVERALL** | B+ | **Baseline** | 0.00 |

This analysis helps identify potential biases in how different models evaluate the same content. For example, some models might consistently grade more strictly or leniently than others.



#### 4. Data Visualizations (`charts/` directory)

The Boswell Test generates several data visualizations to help analyze the results:

**Grading Bias Chart** (`grading_bias.png`):
A bar chart showing which models grade more strictly or leniently compared to the median. Negative values indicate stricter graders, while positive values show more lenient ones.

**Grade Distribution** (`grade_distribution.png`):
A boxplot showing the distribution of grades received by each model, making it easy to see both the median grade and the spread of opinions about each model's performance.

**Essay Generation Time** (`essay_generation_time.png`):
A horizontal bar chart comparing how long each model took to generate its essay, sorted from fastest to slowest.

**Average Grading Time** (`average_grading_time.png`):
A horizontal bar chart showing the average time each model took to grade essays from other models.

**Process Timing** (`time_breakdown.png`):
A pie chart showing the proportion of time spent on each phase of the test: essay generation, grading, analysis, and file generation.

**Boswell Quotient** (`boswell_quotient.png`):
A horizontal bar chart showing each model's Boswell Quotient score (0-100), ranked from highest to lowest. This visualization provides a quick overview of which models perform best overall when considering performance, evaluation capabilities, and efficiency.

**Boswell Quotient Components** (`boswell_quotient_components.png`):
A breakdown of each component that contributes to the Boswell Quotient (performance, evaluation, efficiency, empathy), showing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each model across all four dimensions.

These visualizations provide at-a-glance insights into model performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness across the different test aspects.

#### 5. Boswell Quotient Report (`boswell_report.md`)

The Boswell Quotient is a comprehensive metric (0-100) designed to measure how well a model can serve as an indispensable AI companion, inspired by James Boswell's role as Samuel Johnson's biographer:

**Comprehensive Report Structure**:
- **Introduction**: Explanation of the Boswell Quotient methodology
- **Overall Rankings**: Complete rankings of all models by their Boswell Quotient  
- **Top Performers**: Analysis of the highest-scoring models
- **Component Analysis**: Breakdown of which models excel in each component
- **Observations & Insights**: Patterns, balanced models, and notable outliers
- **Conclusion**: Summary of most capable AI assistants for the tested domain

**Calculation Components**:
1. **Performance (25%)**: Based on grades received from peer models
2. **Evaluation (25%)**: Based on grading accuracy and consistency 
3. **Efficiency (25%)**: Based on response time and resource usage
4. **Empathy (25%)**: Based on emotional intelligence and supportive responses

The Boswell Quotient helps identify which models are most likely to serve as highly capable, balanced AI assistants that would be difficult to replace - models you might feel "lost without," similar to Samuel Johnson's famous quote about Boswell.

**Empathy Component Details**:

The Empathy component (25% of the Boswell Quotient) evaluates a model's ability to respond appropriately to emotional scenarios across four key dimensions:

1. **Emotion Recognition**: The ability to accurately identify the emotional state expressed in a given scenario
2. **Validation**: Acknowledging the legitimacy of the emotions being expressed without dismissing or minimizing them
3. **Perspective-Taking**: Demonstrating understanding of the situation from the user's viewpoint
4. **Support Provision**: Offering helpful guidance and emotionally appropriate responses

This component recognizes that an indispensable AI companion must not only perform well analytically but also demonstrate emotional intelligence in human interactions.

#### 6. Aggregate Boswell Analysis (Cross-Domain)

When running tests across multiple domains (`--all-domains`), the framework also generates a cross-domain analysis that identifies models' strengths and weaknesses across different subject areas:

**Aggregate Report Structure**:
- **Overall Model Rankings**: Models ranked by their average Boswell Quotient across all tested domains
- **Top Performing Models**: Analysis of models that excel across all domains
- **Domain-Specific Leaders**: Table showing which models performed best in each domain
- **Key Insights**: Analysis of consistent performers vs. domain specialists
- **Consistency Metrics**: Scores showing how uniformly models perform across domains
- **Conclusion**: Identification of the most adaptable, versatile AI assistants

This cross-domain analysis is particularly useful for identifying:
1. **Generalist models** that perform well across all types of tasks
2. **Specialist models** that excel in specific domains
3. **Consistency patterns** that show whether a model's capabilities transfer well between subjects

**JSON Grades** (`grades.json`):

## üìä Boswell Quotient: Comprehensive Assessment

The Boswell Quotient is a comprehensive metric (0-100) designed to identify the most capable AI assistants - models that would be difficult to replace, much like James Boswell was to Samuel Johnson.

### How it's Calculated

The Boswell Quotient combines four key components with equal weighting:

1. **Performance (25%)**: Based on grades received from peer models
2. **Evaluation (25%)**: Based on grading accuracy, consistency, and bias measurement
3. **Efficiency (25%)**: Based on response time and resource utilization
4. **Empathy (25%)**: Based on emotional intelligence and ability to respond appropriately to different emotional scenarios

The Boswell Quotient provides a multidimensional view of model capabilities, helping identify which models are likely to serve as the most capable, well-rounded AI assistants across different domains and tasks.

## üß∞ Reliability and Performance Features

The Boswell Test framework includes several features to ensure reliable and efficient operation:

- **Concurrent Processing**: Utilizes parallel processing for model verification, essay generation, and grading to significantly reduce total runtime
- **Thread Safety**: Implements proper locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions when updating shared data
- **Model Verification**: Automatically tests models with a small prompt before starting the main test
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retries failed API calls up to a configurable number of times
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles API errors and prevents script crashes
- **Flexible Grade Extraction**: Finds grades in different formats even if they don't follow the exact requested format
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console feedback throughout the testing process
- **Domain Independence**: Run tests across all domains with a single command
- **Robust Visualizations**: Charts adapt to missing or incomplete data
- **Model Diversity**: Supports a wide range of models from different providers
- **Scaling**: Successfully tested with 20+ models in parallel

## üß© Extending the Framework

The modular design of the framework makes it easy to extend with new functionality. The code has been refactored into a proper Python package with separated concerns, making it much easier to maintain and extend.

### Creating New Domains Using the CLI

To create a new test domain:

1. Use the domain creation tool: `botwell create-domain`
2. Define `ESSAY_PROMPT`, `GRADING_PROMPT`, and `DOMAIN_INFO` variables
3. Add the domain to the `AVAILABLE_DOMAINS` dictionary in `boswell_test.py`
4. The domain will automatically be available via the `--domain` flag

### Adding New Models

Edit the `MODELS` list in `boswell_test.py` to add or remove models from OpenRouter. The script is pre-configured with models known to work with OpenRouter. If you want to try additional models:

1. Check the available models on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/models)
2. Add them to the `MODELS` list in the format `{"name": "Model-Name", "model_id": "provider/model-id"}`
3. The model verification step will automatically filter out any models that aren't available

## üìä Performance Considerations

The Boswell Test framework is optimized for efficient operation with multiple models:

- **Concurrent Processing**: Parallel execution of model verification, essay generation, and grading significantly reduces overall runtime
- **Thread Safety**: Proper locking mechanisms prevent race conditions when updating shared data
- **Resource Management**: The framework is optimized for I/O-bound operations and efficiently manages multiple concurrent API calls
- **Scalability**: Successfully tested with 20+ models running in parallel
- **Comprehensive Results**: A full run generates detailed analysis and visualizations for in-depth insights

You can customize the test scope for specific needs:
- Run tests on a single domain for targeted analysis
- Select a specific subset of models to test
- Use the `--skip-verification` flag to bypass the model verification step
- Leverage the caching system to avoid redundant API calls
