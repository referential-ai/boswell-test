# Median Calculation Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the median calculation function used throughout the Boswell test framework.

## Median Function Definition
The function `median_of_list` in `botwell/utils/__init__.py` implements a standard median calculation algorithm:

- For odd-length lists: the middle value of the sorted list is returned
- For even-length lists: the average of the two middle values of the sorted list is returned
- For empty lists: 0.0 is returned

```python
def median_of_list(lst):
    """Returns the middle sorted values for both even and odd n;
    for odd n, just take the middle sorted value; for even n,
    take the average of the two middle sorted values.
    
    Args:
        lst: A list of numeric values
        
    Returns:
        The median value as a float, or 0.0 if the list is empty
    """
    if not lst:
        return 0.0  # Handle empty list case
    n, srtlst = len(lst), sorted(lst)
    return (srtlst[n//2] + srtlst[(n-1)//2])/2
```

## Usage
This function is used throughout the codebase instead of Python's built-in `statistics.median` to ensure consistent behavior. It is particularly important for grade calculations in the following modules:

- `botwell/core/test.py`: Calculating summary statistics for model performance
- `botwell/core/grading.py`: Calculating grading bias analysis
- `botwell/reporting/excel.py`: Calculating median grades for Excel reports
- `botwell/reporting/tables.py`: Calculating median grades for various report formats

## Implementation Notes
The formula `(srtlst[n//2] + srtlst[(n-1)//2])/2` is an elegant solution that works for both odd and even-length lists:

- For odd-length lists (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with n=5):
  - n//2 = 2, (n-1)//2 = 2
  - (list[2] + list[2])/2 = (3 + 3)/2 = 3.0

- For even-length lists (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4] with n=4):
  - n//2 = 2, (n-1)//2 = 1
  - (list[2] + list[1])/2 = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5

## Testing
The function is tested in `tests/test_median_function.py` with a variety of test cases, including:
- Odd-length lists
- Even-length lists
- Empty lists
- Single-element lists
- Two-element lists

All tests must pass before deploying changes to this function, as it is critical for grade calculations throughout the system.
